The diagnosis can be challenging because some patients may present with vague symptoms. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the better the outcomes [1]. Boerhaave’s syndrome accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of esophageal rupture. Although the actual incidence of esophageal perforation worldwide is unclear, some studies estimate an incidence of approximately 3.1 per 1,000,000 per year [1].\n\nThe management of Boerhaave syndrome relies on rapid recognition and intervention as a lack of therapeutic interventions can be fatal [1]. The treatment options available are either conservative or invasive. Conservative treatment involves the use of antibiotics, chest tube insertion, and parenteral nutrition. In contrast, invasive treatment entails surgical repair of the esophagus, which is the most common and effective treatment option. Thoracotomy and laparotomy are both invasive and may involve resection of the perforated area with primary repair, as well as other measures to secure the surgical repair. Overall, it's crucial to understand that Boerhaave's syndrome is a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention [1].\n\nBoerhaave’s syndrome is more frequent in people assigned male at birth and in people older than 50, and up to 80% of those affected are middle-aged males.

In one of his publications entitled “History of a Grievous Disease Not Previously Described,” he discussed the case of Baron Jan von Wassenaer, a Holland admiral, who, after a feast, began to vomit and suffered left-sided chest pain shortly afterward. Unfortunately, he survived for only 24 hours after the incident. Today, Boerhaave’s syndrome accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of esophageal rupture. Although the actual incidence of esophageal perforation worldwide is unclear, some studies estimate an incidence of approximately 3.1 per 1,000,000 per year. The patient population who suffer from Boerhaave’s syndrome varies, but the risk is highest in middle-aged males.

It happens when forceful vomiting or excessive straining cause your esophagus wall to split open. Healthcare professionals call this an \"effort rupture\" or “spontaneous rupture\" to distinguish it from ruptures caused by direct injury to your esophagus. Boerhaave's syndrome is an uncommon cause of esophageal rupture, affecting an estimated 0.0003% of the population. It represents 15% of all traumatic ruptures of the esophagus.\n  What is the difference between Boerhaave’s syndrome and Mallory Weiss syndrome?\n  A Mallory Weiss tear is a tear in the inner lining of your esophagus. Like Boerhaave’s syndrome, it also occurs after forceful vomiting or straining, and both are associated with drinking too much alcohol. A Mallory Weiss tear will cause you to vomit blood, but it doesn't tear all the way through the esophagus. Boerhaave’s syndrome, on the other hand, ruptures the full thickness of the esophagus wall. This is also called a transmural tear. A transmural tear will likely need emergency repair, and repairing it can be a matter of life or death.\n  - Swelling in the tissues of the chest cavity with air or fluid.\n  A split in the esophagus is an emergency and can be fatal. That’s because the esophagus, as part of the gastrointestinal tract, is designed to carry substances that are toxic to the rest of your body. If food particles, bacteria and digestive chemicals leak from your esophagus into your chest or abdomen, serious infection can result. Infection that enters the systemic bloodstream can lead to septicemia and sepsis, a life-threatening reaction that can include shock, multiple organ failure and death.\n  It can affect anyone but is more frequent in people assigned male at birth and in people older than 50. Up to 80% of those affected are middle-aged males. It's more common in people who drink heavily.\n"

Rib fractures are usually caused by car accidents, sports injuries or other traumas. It’s possible to break a rib without experiencing trauma, too.\n  Your ribs are some of the strongest bones in your body, so it’s rare to fracture a rib without experiencing a major trauma like a car accident or fall. Around 30% of people who experience a trauma to their chest break at least one rib.\n  Rib fractures — like all bone fractures — can affect anyone. This is especially true because they’re usually caused by car accidents and other traumas. People with osteoporosis (weakened bones) have an increased risk for all types of broken bones, including rib fractures. Athletes who play contact sports are more likely to break a rib than most people.\n  Even if you can recover with at-home treatments, rib fractures can have life-threatening complications. See a healthcare provider or go to the emergency room if you’re experiencing symptoms like pain and tenderness around your ribs and chest, or if you have trouble breathing.\n  A healthcare provider will classify your rib fracture based on the type of break you experienced.

This is typically done in people who have trouble swallowing.\n  X-ray of the upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus and stomach. This is particularly useful for people who are having trouble swallowing.\n  An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett esophagus. In some instances, if a narrowing is seen in the esophagus, it can be stretched or dilated during this procedure. This is done to improve trouble swallowing (dysphagia).\n  - Transnasal esophagoscopy. This test is done to look for any damage in your esophagus.

Acute HIV infection is the earliest stage and develops within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV. During this time, some people have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and rash. The virus attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells of the immune system. During the acute HIV infection stage, the level of HIV in the blood is very high, which greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission [1][2][3]. It is essential to identify acute infection early for early intervention and prevention [3]. Chronic HIV infection is the second stage and may last for years without medication. During this stage, HIV continues to multiply in the body but at very low levels, and people with chronic infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms. Without ART, chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though in some people it may advance faster [1][2].",

During this time, some people have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and rash. In the acute stage of infection, HIV multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body. The virus attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells (CD4 T lymphocyte) of the immune system. During the acute HIV infection stage, the level of HIV in the blood is very high, which greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission. A person may experience significant health benefits if they start ART during this stage.\n  - The three stages of HIV infection are (1) acute HIV infection, (2) chronic HIV infection, and (3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n  AIDSAIDS is the final, most severe stage of HIV infection. Because HIV has severely damaged the immune system, the body cannot fight off opportunistic infections. (Opportunistic infections are infections and infection-related cancers that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in people with healthy immune systems.) People with HIV are diagnosed with AIDS if they have a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or if they have certain opportunistic infections. Once a person is diagnosed with AIDS, they can have a high viral load and are able to transmit HIV to others very easily. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\n  Chronic HIV InfectionThe second stage of HIV infection is chronic HIV infection (also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency). During this stage, HIV continues to multiply in the body but at very low levels. People with chronic HIV infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms. Without ART, chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though in some people it may advance faster. People who are taking ART may be in this stage for several decades. While it is still possible to transmit HIV to others during this stage, people who take ART exactly as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex.\n  - Without treatment with HIV medicines, HIV infection advances in stages, getting worse over time.\n[2] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524\n  Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks.\n  HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood and from illicit injection drug use or sharing needles. It can also be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.\n  Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.\n  The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.\n[3] https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2021/0401/p407.html\n  The risk of HIV transmission from untreated people with acute or early HIV infection is much higher than from people with established chronic infection who are receiving suppressive ART. Therefore, improved identification of acute infection allows for earlier intervention, including ART initiation and education about transmission prevention (i.e., pre- and postexposure prophylaxis for partners who are seronegative).15–18 Acute symptomatic HIV is often unrecognized, and fewer than 50% of people will have an identifiable acute illness.19 Many respiratory illnesses, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, are more common; therefore, a careful assessment of recent risk behaviors and exposures may be a factor that prompts HIV testing.\n  |Test when acute HIV infection is suspected in people with recent exposure history (i.e., within the previous two months) and symptoms of recent viral infection, including fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, headache, sore throat, and diarrhea.|\n  After a diagnosis of HIV, the initial history should document details about other chronic health conditions, hospitalizations, medications and allergies, mental and behavioral health, substance use, sexual health history, and experience with HIV pre- or postexposure prophylaxis. For people with advanced HIV, which is generally indicated by a CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 200 cells per μL (0.20 × 109 per L), a full review of systems to assess for opportunistic infections or conditions associated with significant immunosuppression such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, tuberculosis, HIV-associated central nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders, and disseminated fungal or viral infections is recommended. When patients with chronic HIV infection reengage in care, clinicians should obtain a comprehensive history of previous ART regimens and treatment responses, including previous laboratory results. The initial examination generally shows no specific HIV-related manifestations unless symptomatic acute infection or advanced HIV disease is present.\n  |Test when chronic HIV infection is suspected, based on clinical presentation and risk or exposure history. Symptoms of chronic untreated HIV include fever, lymphadenopathy, malaise or fatigue, weight loss, and symptoms from undiagnosed opportunistic infections.|\n  HIV screening and diagnostic testing are essential for timely ART initiation and transmission prevention because approximately 38% of new transmissions are from people with HIV who are unaware of their HIV status.2 Testing with the fourth-generation combination HIV antigen-antibody immunoassay is widely available and is recommended for screening people 15 to 65 years of age and for testing people with risk factors11–14 (Table 1). In addition to HIV-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies, which typically develop three or more weeks following infection, the fourth-generation HIV test detects the p24 antigen that appears as early as two weeks after infection. Inclusion of the p24 antigen shortens the time frame for detecting HIV, increasing the likelihood of identifying people with HIV who recently acquired the infection (i.e., within the previous one to two months).\n  The diagnosis of HIV should be established with documented laboratory test results. Abnormal results from home-based, point-of-care, or rapid tests should be followed with standard, instrument-based laboratory assays. After the diagnosis is confirmed, comprehensive testing should be ordered (Table 2).4,20 Testing should include primary care screening and HIV-specific baseline laboratory testing with a CD4 count, quantitative plasma HIV RNA (viral load), and HIV drug-resistance assessment. The CD4 count reflects the degree of immune system impairment and helps determine if opportunistic infection prophylaxis is indicated. The HIV viral load indicates how much active viral replication is occurring. Regular viral load monitoring during treatment is the most important indicator of a response to ART. HIV drug-resistance testing guides the initial selection of the ART regimen by identifying clinically significant mutations in the genes (reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase) targeted by commonly used antiretroviral drugs.

The shortage of red blood cells can result from a variety of causes and can range from mild to severe [1]. Iron-deficiency anemia is one common type of anemia, which happens when a person's body doesn't have enough iron to produce hemoglobin, the protein in the red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen throughout the body [2]. Other causes of anemia include chronic diseases, pregnancy, heavy menstrual bleeding, vitamin B12 deficiency, and inadequate iron intake for infants and children [1][2]. Anemia usually shows no symptoms at first, but as it worsens, a person may experience tiredness, weakness, and other complications depending on the severity of the condition [1][2]. Medical treatment for anemia depends on the specific cause but may include taking supplements, undergoing medical procedures, and consuming a healthy, varied diet to prevent certain types of anemia [1][2].

Anemia can be temporary or long term and can range from mild to severe. In most cases, anemia has more than one cause. See your doctor if you suspect that you have anemia. It can be a warning sign of serious illness.\n  At first, anemia can be so mild that you don't notice it. But symptoms worsen as anemia worsens.\n  Anemia signs and symptoms vary depending on the cause and severity of anemia. Depending on the causes of your anemia, you might have no symptoms.\n  Treatments for anemia, which depend on the cause, range from taking supplements to having medical procedures.

Hemoglobin is the substance in your red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen throughout your body.\n  There are many anemia types, each causing red blood cell levels to drop.\n  Anemia happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells or your red blood cells don’t work as they should. Your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Oxygen powers your cells and gives you energy. Without healthy red blood cells that do their job, your body doesn’t get the energy it needs to function. While some types of anemia are short-term and mild, others can last for a lifetime. Left untreated, anemia may be life-threatening.\n  - People with chronic conditions: Some chronic conditions like autoimmune diseases or cancer may increase the risk of anemia. This is anemia of chronic disease.\n  When someone develops anemia, they’re said to be anemic, meaning they have symptoms of anemia, like being very tired or feeling cold all of the time. Anemia affects different people in different ways:\n  - Women who are pregnant: Women who are pregnant may develop iron-deficiency anemia, which may increase the chance of complications such as premature birth or giving birth to babies with low birth weight.\n  - Newborns: Some infants are born with low red blood cell counts. Most newborns don’t need medical treatment for anemia, but some with severe anemia may need blood transfusions.\n  - People age 65 and older: People over 65 are more likely to have iron-poor diets and certain chronic diseases that increase their risk of developing anemia. If they develop anemia, they may have heart conditions or weakness that makes it hard for them to get around. They may have confusion or depression.\n  - Women and people designated female at birth (DFAB): Women and people DFAB who have heavy periods (menstrual bleeding) or conditions like uterine fibroids may lose blood and develop anemia.\n  - Pernicious anemia: Pernicious anemia, one of the causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, is an autoimmune condition that prevents your body from absorbing vitamin B12.\n  - Infants: Infants may get less iron than they need when they start eating solid food. That’s because the iron in solid food isn’t absorbed as easily as iron in breast milk or formula. Infants with anemia may appear lethargic.\n  - Children: Children do a lot of growing between birth and age 2. Children going through growth spurts need more iron. Children with anemia may develop related problems such as delayed development of motor skills and issues with learning.\n"

The symptoms of viral pharyngitis can vary depending on the causative agent and the affected person's immune capacity [1]. Generally, the symptoms include pain, scratchiness, difficulty swallowing, fever, fatigue, and swollen glands in the neck or jaw [2][3]. On its own, viral pharyngitis resolves without any treatment in a week or less [3]. The treatment mainly aims to alleviate the symptoms such as saltwater gargles, pain relievers, and extra fluids. However, if bacterial pharyngitis is suspected, antibiotics are needed to avoid potential complications. If the symptoms don't go away in a week, it is best to consult a doctor [2][3].",

This can also be due to a bacterial infection such as Streptococcus pyogenes. The other less common causes include fungal infections and non-infectious causes like allergies, trauma, cancer, acid reflux, medications, and other toxins such as those in smoking. In younger children, the infection is less severe. It rarely presents as acute pharyngitis. There is mucopurulent rhinitis (pus discharge from nose) and low-grade fever.\n  Pharyngitis is an upper respiratory tract infection that causes inflammation of the mucous membrane of the oropharynx (middle part of the throat behind the oral cavity). It is otherwise called cobblestone throat or sore throat. It usually causes pain, scratchiness in the throat, and difficulty in swallowing. The symptoms vary according to the causative agent and the immune capacity of the affected individual.\n  In particular, adenovirus causes fever, sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, and conjunctivitis. This is named pharyngoconjunctival fever. It directly invades the pharyngeal mucosa, which is not true in the case of rhinovirus. Rhinovirus causes increased mucous secretion and swelling of the nose's mucous membrane.\n  Epstein-Barr virus causes edema (swelling due to excess fluid) and hyperemia (increased blood in the blood vessels) of the tonsils and pharynx, inflammatory exudate (the fluid that leaks out of blood vessels), fatigue, skin rash, and excessive growth of lymphoid tissue in the nasopharynx.\n  The following are symptoms of a viral infection that is different from a bacterial infection which includes:\n  Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva in the eye).\n[2] https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pharyngitis\n  Pharyngitis — commonly known as sore throat — is an inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in a sore throat. Thus, pharyngitis is a symptom, rather than a condition. It is usually caused by viral and/or bacterial infections, such as the common cold and flu (both viral infections) or by infection with the Streptococcus bacterium (strep throat). Pharyngitis can also occur with mononucleosis (aka “mono”), a viral infection.\n  The treatment depends on the cause. Viral pharyngitis goes away on its own with salt water gargles, pain relievers and extra fluids to help alleviate the symptoms. Bacterial pharyngitis is treated with antibiotics; and fungal pharyngitis, with antifungal medications. Prompt antibiotic therapy is needed for strep throat because untreated, it can sometimes cause kidney problems and rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart valves. A full assessment in the clinic will guide treatment for other causes.\n  Diagnosis requires a physical exam and laryngoscopy (scope exam in a clinic) to assess for all the possible causes of pharyngitis.\n  Fungal pharyngitis occurs in the setting of immunosuppression or chronic steroid and antibiotic use. Sometimes, allergies, such as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, can cause sore throat. Dry indoor air and chronic mouth breathing, especially in the winter, can lead to recurrent sore throat, particularly in the morning, after waking up. Muscle strain associated with voice use can cause a pain in the throat that is similar to pharyngitis. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can lead to chronic sore throat because of stomach acid reflux irritating the throat.\n  Other symptoms may be present, depending on the cause. These include fatigue, malaise, muscle aches, headache and fever — especially with the flu or other viral infections.\n  Call your doctor if you notice any of the symptoms listed above.

    "inguinal hernia": {
        "response_text": "An inguinal hernia occurs when part of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity or intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. It can be caused by a weakening of the muscles in the lower abdomen, chronic pressure on the muscle wall, or a birth defect [1][2][3]. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia and are much more common in men than women [1][2]. However, they can occur in both sexes and at any age [1][2]. Symptoms may include a visible bulge in the groin area, which can sometimes extend down into the scrotum in men, and pain when coughing, bending over or lifting heavy objects [1][2][3]. It's important to identify and treat inguinal hernias promptly because they can lead to life-threatening complications and do not improve on their own. Surgery is often recommended to correct the problem [1][3]. Infants and children, particularly premature babies, are also at risk for inguinal hernias [1][2][3].",

Inguinal hernias occur because of a weakening of the muscles in the lower abdomen.\n  Indirect inguinal hernia. This is the most common type, and a type of hernia that you may be born with. Although it can occur in men and women, it is much more common in men. This is because the male testicle starts inside the abdomen and has to go down through an opening in the groin area to reach the scrotum (the sac that holds the testicles). If this opening does not close at birth, a hernia develops. In women, this type of hernia can occur if reproductive organs or the small intestine slides into the groin area because of a weakness in the abdominal muscles.\n  An inguinal hernia forms when your intestines and the peritoneum push through the muscles and appear as a bulge under your skin. Inguinal hernias are dangerous because they tend to keep getting larger and your intestine can get trapped inside the bulge and lose its blood supply. This is called a strangulated inguinal hernia, and surgery may be needed to correct the problem.\n  Inguinal hernias may occur on one or both sides of the body and are much more common in men than women. An inguinal hernia can appear at any age. Infants may be born with one that doesn’t show up until they become adults. About five out of every 100 children are born with the condition.\n  Direct inguinal hernia. This type of hernia is caused by weakening of your abdominal muscles over time and is more likely to be seen in adults. Direct inguinal hernias occur only in men.\n  An inguinal hernia can also develop over time if you increase pressure on the walls of your abdominal muscles through activities like straining to go to the bathroom, coughing over a long period, being overweight, or lifting heavy weights. If you have a family history of inguinal hernia, you may be at a higher risk for one. Infants born before their due date are also at higher risk.\n  The main symptom is a visible bulge in your groin area. In men, an inguinal hernia may extend down into the scrotum and cause an enlarged scrotum. Small hernias may slide back and forth through the opening in the abdomen and not cause any symptoms. Larger hernias may be massaged back into the abdomen. Symptoms of hernias that go back and forth include:\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16266-inguinal-hernia\n  What are the symptoms of an inguinal hernia?\n  - Direct inguinal hernia: A direct inguinal hernia penetrates directly through the wall of your inguinal canal. This type of hernia occurs in adults over time, from a combination of weakening abdominal muscles and chronic pressure on the muscle wall.\n  - Indirect inguinal hernia: An indirect inguinal hernia enters your inguinal canal through the top. This usually occurs because of a birth defect. In some fetuses, the opening to their canal doesn’t close all the way during development in the uterus.\n  Inguinal hernias occur in the inguinal canal, which is a passageway that runs down either side of your pelvis into your sex organs. They're also called groin hernias. (“Inguinal” means “in the groin.”) They're the most common type of groin hernia, though not the only type. (Less common are femoral hernias, which happen in the smaller femoral canal that runs underneath the inguinal canal.)\n  A hernia occurs when tissue from one body cavity bulges through an opening in your muscle wall into another. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia. They happen when abdominal tissue, such as belly fat or a loop of intestines, bulges through an opening in your lower abdominal wall . This is the wall that separates your abdomen from your groin.\n  Not all inguinal hernias have symptoms. Sometimes, symptoms come and go. A hernia may slide in and out of the opening, or you may only feel it during certain activities. In children, you may see a lump in their groin area that appears bigger when they cry. It may go away when they sleep. An indirect inguinal hernia may not be palpable (able to be felt) to the touch because it may be tucked behind muscle fibers.\n  For reasons of anatomy, inguinal hernias usually affect people assigned male at birth (AMAB), by a ratio of 10:1. Your testicle begins above your lower abdominal wall and descends through your inguinal canal into your scrotum. The place where your testicle passes through is more susceptible to a hernia because it’s a preexisting opening, which is more easily reopened. And, sometimes, it doesn’t close all the way during development in the first place.\n  Up to 75% of all hernias are inguinal hernias. Around 25% of people AMAB will have an inguinal hernia during their lifetime, compared to 2% of people AFAB. Direct (acquired) inguinal hernias are more common in middle-aged and older men. Indirect inguinal hernias affect up to 4.5% of children, including 2% of babies AMAB and 1% of babies AFAB. Premature babies are up to 30% more likely to get one.\n  What's the difference between a direct inguinal hernia and an indirect inguinal hernia?\n  In people assigned female at birth (AFAB), the inguinal canal is narrower and begins under their abdominal wall. It carries the round ligament that supports their uterus, and this tough ligament helps to reinforce their muscle wall. However, women with connective tissue diseases may be more susceptible to hernias where connective tissue attaches their uterus to their inguinal canal. Congenital indirect inguinal hernias may also affect babies who are AFAB.\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547\n  Inguinal hernias occur when part of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (omentum) or intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdomen — often along the inguinal canal, which carries the spermatic cord in men.\n  An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. The resulting bulge can be painful, especially when you cough, bend over or lift a heavy object. However, many hernias do not cause pain.\n  An inguinal hernia isn't necessarily dangerous. It doesn't improve on its own, however, and can lead to life-threatening complications. Your doctor is likely to recommend surgery to fix an inguinal hernia that's painful or enlarging. Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure.\n  Inguinal hernias in newborns and children result from a weakness in the abdominal wall that's present at birth. Sometimes the hernia will be visible only when an infant is crying, coughing or straining during a bowel movement. He or she might be irritable and have less appetite than usual.\n  In an older child, a hernia is likely to be more apparent when the child coughs, strains during a bowel movement or stands for a long period.\n"

These symptoms typically start in minutes to hours and then increase very rapidly to life-threatening levels. Urgent medical treatment is required to prevent serious harm or death, even if the patient has used an epipen or has taken other medications in response, and even if symptoms appear to be improving.\n  Anaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and up to 2 hours if from eating food. The most common areas affected include: skin (80–90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30–45%), heart and vasculature (10–45%), and central nervous system (10–15%) with usually two or more being involved.\n  Worldwide, 0.05–2% of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life. Globally, as underreporting declined into the 2010s, the rate appeared to be increasing. It occurs most often in young people and females. About 99.7% of people hospitalized with anaphylaxis in the United States survive.\n  The primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle, intravenous fluids, then placing the person \"in a reclining position with feet elevated to help restore normal blood flow\". Additional doses of epinephrine may be required. Other measures, such as antihistamines and steroids, are complementary. Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector, commonly called an \"epipen\" and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis. Immediately contacting ambulance / EMT services is always strongly recommended, regardless of any on site treatment. Getting to a doctor or hospital as soon as possible is absolutely required in all cases, even if it appears to be getting better.\n  |Differential diagnosis||Allergic reaction, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, carcinoid syndrome|\n  |Angioedema of the face such that the boy cannot open his eyes. This reaction was caused by an allergen exposure.|\n  Common causes include allergies to insect bites and stings, allergies to foods – including nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fresh fruits or dried fruits; allergies to sulfites – a class of food preservatives and a byproduct in some fermented foods like vinegar; allergies to medications – including some antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin; allergy to general anaesthetic (used to make people sleep during surgery); allergy to contrast agents – dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of the body show up better on scans; allergy to latex – a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms. Other causes can include physical exercise, and cases may also occur in some people due to escalating reactions to simple throat irritation or may also occur without an obvious reason. The mechanism involves the release of inflammatory mediators in a rapidly escalating cascade from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms. Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen or irritant and in some cases, reaction to physical exercise.\n  Symptoms typically include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, or swelling (angioedema) of the affected tissues. Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness. Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20% of cases. Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva. The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen.\n  |Symptoms||Itchy rash, throat swelling, numbness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, low blood pressure|\n"

In the past, it was thought to primarily affect children, but now it is more common in adults [1][3]. The symptoms usually appear suddenly and get worse quickly in both children and adults, and may include difficulty and pain when swallowing, drooling, abnormal or high-pitched breathing noises, and fever [2][3]. Epiglottitis is mostly caused by infections, bacterial or viral, but there can be non-infectious causes like thermal, caustic, or foreign body ingestion. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the most common cause of epiglottitis in children, but this has decreased significantly since the widespread availability of vaccinations. However, the incidence in adults has remained stable [1][2][3]. The evaluation of a patient with epiglottitis should be done carefully and cautiously, and the patient's airway must be secured under controlled circumstances to avoid respiratory distress [1]. Treatment typically involves intravenous antibiotics and securing the airway, which may involve intubation or tracheostomy under the supervision of an interprofessional team, including a consult with an otolaryngologist [1]. Modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members can help to improve outcomes for patients affected by epiglottitis [1].",

This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and pathophysiology of epiglottitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.\n  - Recall the presentation of a patient with epiglottitis.\n  While in the past epiglottitis was thought to be primarily a disease of young children, it is now much more likely practitioners will encounter epiglottitis/supraglottitis in adults as well.\n  - Describe the evaluation of a patient with epiglottitis.\n  Before the development of the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the majority of cases were caused by H.influenzae and the condition was far more common. In the post-vaccine era, the pathogens responsible are more varied and can also be polymicrobial. For this reason, the term \"supraglottitis\" is often preferred, as the infections may affect the supraglottic structures more generally. Edema due to infection of the epiglottis and supraglottic structures can be gradually progressive until a critical mass is reached, and the clinical scenario can rapidly deteriorate and lead to airway obstruction, respiratory distress, and death. Symptoms can be exacerbated by patient discomfort and agitation, particularly in children, so any patient with a diagnosis of true supraglottitis must have their airway secured under the most controlled circumstances possible, and every attempt should be made to keep the patient as calm and comfortable as possible until an airway is secured. The airway should not be instrumented for oral exams or endoscopy in the clinic or Emergency Department, and no patient with a potentially unstable airway should be sent to the radiology department for imaging.\n  The cause of epiglottitis is most commonly infectious, whether bacterial, viral, or fungal in origin. In children, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) is still the most common cause. However, this has decreased dramatically since the widespread availability of immunizations. Other agents such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus have been implicated. In immunocompromised patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida have been named. Noninfectious causes can be traumatic such as thermal, caustic, or foreign body ingestion.\n  While viruses do not cause epiglottitis, a prior viral infection may allow bacterial superinfection to develop. Viruses that may allow a superinfection include varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, and Epstein Barr virus.\n  Since the addition of the HIB vaccine to the infant immunization schedule in many countries worldwide, the annual incidence of epiglottitis in children has decreased overall. However, the incidence in adults has remained stable. Additionally, the age of children who have had epiglottitis has increased from three years old to six to twelve years old in the post-vaccine era.\n  - Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by epiglottitis.\n  StatPearls [Internet].

Your epiglottis is a thin flap of cartilage near the base of your tongue. It keeps food and liquids from going down your windpipe (trachea) when you swallow.\n  Epiglottitis symptoms usually appear suddenly and get worse quickly. Sometimes, in older children and adults, it may take a few days for symptoms to fully develop. The most common epiglottitis symptoms include:\n  You may also hear the term “acute epiglottitis.” This refers to the very sudden and intense onset of symptoms, including difficulty breathing and swallowing.\n  Epiglottitis can affect people of any age. It affects men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) more than women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) at a rate of 2.5 to 1.\n  Before the widespread use of Hib vaccinations in 1985, epiglottitis mainly affected children between the ages of 3 and 5. By the year 2000, the annual incidence of invasive Hib infection, a primary cause of epiglottitis, in children ages 3 to 5 decreased 99%, to less than 1 case out of every 100,000.\n  - Difficulty and pain when swallowing (a main symptom in older children and adults).\n  - Drooling (a main symptom in older children and adults).\n  - Abnormal or high-pitched breathing noises (a main symptom in children).\n  - Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher.\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epiglottitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372227\n  Epiglottitis can happen at any age. Once, mainly children got it. The most common cause of epiglottitis in children was infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria. The bacterium also causes pneumonia, meningitis and blood infections.\n  Children can develop symptoms of epiglottitis within hours. Symptoms can include:\n  Epiglottitis happens when the epiglottis — a small cartilage \"lid\" that covers the windpipe — swells. The swelling blocks the flow of air into the lungs. Epiglottitis can be deadly.\n  Routine Hib vaccination for infants has made epiglottitis rare in children. It's now more common in adults. The condition needs quick care to prevent deadly complications.\n  Many factors can cause the epiglottis to swell. These factors include infections, burns from hot liquids and injuries to the throat.\n  The throat includes the esophagus; windpipe, also known as the trachea; voice box, also known as the larynx; tonsils; and epiglottis.\n  - Unusual, high-pitched sound when breathing in, known as stridor.\n  Adults might get symptoms over days rather than hours. Symptoms might include:\n  - Sitting up or leaning forward to ease breathing.\n"

        "source_text": "[1] https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/guillain-barre-syndrome\n  Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which your immune system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system—the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. GBS can range from a very mild case with brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving you unable to breathe independently. Fortunately, most people eventually recover from even the most severe cases of GBS. After recovery, some people will continue to have some degree of weakness.\n  Who is more likely to get Guillain-Barré syndrome?\n  What they do know is that the affected person's immune system begins to attack the body itself. It may be this immune attack starts as a fight against an infection and that some chemicals on infecting bacteria and viruses resemble those on nerve cells, which, in turn, also become targets of attack. Since the body's own immune system does the damage, GBS is called an autoimmune disease (“auto” meaning “self”). Normally the immune system uses antibodies (molecules produced in an immune response) and special white blood cells to protect us by attacking infecting microorganisms (bacteria and viruses). In Guillain-Barré syndrome, however, the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy nerves.\n  Sensation changes—Since nerves are damaged in GBS, your brain may receive abnormal sensory signals from the rest of your body. This results in unexplained, spontaneous sensations, called paresthesias, that you may feel as tingling, a sense of insects crawling under the skin (called formications), and pain. Deep muscular pain may be experienced in the back and/or legs.\n  Weakness—The weakness seen in GBS usually comes on quickly and worsens over hours or days. Symptoms are usually equal on both sides of the body (called symmetric). You may first notice weakness as difficulty climbing stairs or with walking. Symptoms often affect the arms, breathing muscles, and even the face, reflecting more widespread nerve damage. Occasionally symptoms start in the upper body and move down to the legs and feet. Muscles controlling breathing can weaken to the point that you might need a machine to help you breathe.\n  GBS can increase in intensity over a period of hours, days, or weeks until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases, the disorder is life-threatening—potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or heart rate.\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome\n  Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing weakness of the breathing muscles and, therefore, requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.\n  |Other names||Guillain–Barré–Strohl syndrome, Landry's paralysis, postinfectious polyneuritis|\n  Many people with Guillain–Barré syndrome have experienced the signs and symptoms of an infection in the 3–6 weeks before the onset of the neurological symptoms. This may consist of upper respiratory tract infection (rhinitis, sore throat), or diarrhea.\n  The first symptoms of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, alone or in combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress for as long as four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves that supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level (\"plateau phase\") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain, and pain in the head and neck relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.\n  In those with severe weakness, prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, will lead to good recovery in the majority of cases. Recovery may take weeks to years, with about a third having some permanent weakness. Globally, death occurs in approximately 7.5% of those affected. Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at 1 or 2 cases per 100,000 people every year. Both sexes and all parts of the world have similar rates of disease.\n  Although the cause is unknown, the underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, by surgery, and rarely, by vaccination. The diagnosis is usually based on the signs and symptoms through the exclusion of alternative causes and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There are a number of subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793\n  Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves.

But two-thirds of patients report symptoms of an infection in the six weeks preceding. These include a COVID-19, respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection or Zika virus.\n  These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body. In its most severe form Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition must be hospitalized to receive treatment.\n  Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in your feet and legs and spreading to your upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.\n  There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome, but several treatments can ease symptoms and reduce the duration of the illness. Although most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, some severe cases can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first started. Some people may have lasting effects from it, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.\n  The demyelinating form of Guillain-Barre syndrome destroys the protective covering of the peripheral nerves (myelin sheath), preventing the nerves from transmitting signals to the brain.\n"

        "response_text": "Acute laryngitis is a temporary inflammation of the larynx caused by an infection, typically a viral upper respiratory infection [1]. It usually lasts for 3 to 7 days and is often self-limiting. Symptoms may include a hoarse or raspy voice, early vocal fatigue, a dry cough, and in rare cases, significant breathing difficulties. While acute laryngitis does not typically require medical treatment, it is important to avoid strenuous use of the voice during this time to prevent damage to the vocal cords [3]. If the symptoms persist for more than 3 weeks, then it can be considered chronic laryngitis [2]. In addition to viral infection, acute laryngitis can also be caused by non-infectious factors such as vocal trauma/abuse/misuse, allergies, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, environmental pollution, smoking, inhalational injuries, or functional/conversion disorders [1]. \n\nTreatment for acute laryngitis generally involves self-care measures such as resting the voice and staying hydrated. Patients may also use humidifiers and throat lozenges to relieve symptoms [3]. If the patient experiences significant dyspnea, shortness of breath, or audible stridor during acute laryngitis, a more serious disease process may be present, and the clinician may pursue additional workup [1].

Acute Laryngitis is often a mild and self-limiting condition that typically lasts for a period of 3 to 7 days. If this condition lasts for over 3 weeks, then it is termed as chronic laryngitis.\n  The most common cause of acute laryngitis is viral upper respiratory infection (URI), and this diagnosis can often be obtained from taking a thorough history of present illness from the patient. In the absence of infectious history or sick contacts, additional causes of non-infectious laryngitis must be explored. Presenting symptoms often include voice changes (patients may report hoarseness or a \"raspy\" voice), early vocal fatigue (particularly in singers or professional voice users), or a dry cough. Breathing difficulties are rare (though possible) in acute laryngitis, but the presence of significant dyspnea, shortness of breath (SOB), or audible stridor should alert the clinician that a more dangerous disease process may be present. Suspicion should be heightened in smokers and the immunocompromised, as these patients are at higher risk for malignancy and more dangerous infections that may otherwise mimic acute laryngitis. Similarly, the presence of significant dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, or posturing are very rare in simple acute laryngitis and warrant additional workup.\n  The etiology of acute laryngitis can be classified as either infectious or non-infectious. The infectious form is more common and usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection.\n  - Review how to counsel a patient with acute laryngitis.\n  Acute infectious laryngitis in adults is most commonly caused by the viral organisms listed above. These same agents are common in pediatric acute laryngitis, though it is important to remember croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) in children, which is due to parainfluenza virus (most commonly parainfluenza-1). This may present with isolated vocal symptoms, but classically includes a characteristic \"barking\" cough and may progress to inspiratory or biphasic stridor.\n  - Explain how to diagnose and manage acute laryngitiss as well as develop a differential diagnosis to rule out more serious pathology.\n  The most commonly encountered bacterial organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, in that order. Exanthematous febrile illnesses such as measles, chickenpox, and whooping cough are also associated with acute laryngitis symptoms, so it is prudent to obtain an accurate immunization history. Laryngitis caused by fungal infection is very rare in immunocompetent individuals, and more often presents as chronic laryngitis in the immunocompromised or in patients using inhaled steroid medications.\n  - Summarize an interprofessional, team approach to improve care for patients with acute laryngitis.\n  Viral agents such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza are all potential etiologic agents (listed in roughly descending order of frequency). It is possible for bacterial superinfection to occur in the setting of viral laryngitis, this classically occurs approximately seven days after symptoms begin.\n[2] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/laryngitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374262\n  You can manage most acute cases of laryngitis with self-care steps, such as resting your voice and drinking plenty of fluids. Strenuous use of your voice during an episode of acute laryngitis can damage your vocal cords.\n  Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection and aren't serious. Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition.\n  Laryngitis is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation or infection.\n  In most cases laryngitis symptoms last less than a couple of weeks and are caused by something minor, such as a virus. Less often, laryngitis symptoms are caused by something more serious or long lasting. Laryngitis signs and symptoms can include:\n  But with laryngitis, your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated. This makes the vocal cords swell, which distorts the sounds produced by air passing over them. As a result, your voice sounds hoarse. In some cases of laryngitis, your voice can become almost undetectable.\n  Inside the larynx are your vocal cords — two folds of mucous membrane covering muscle and cartilage. Normally, your vocal cords open and close smoothly, forming sounds through their movement and vibration.\n  Speech occurs when air flows from the lungs, up the windpipe (trachea) and through the voice box (larynx). This causes the vocal cords to vibrate, creating sound. Sound is shaped into words by the muscles controlling the soft palate, tongue and lips.\n[3] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22268-laryngitis\n  There are two types of laryngitis: acute and chronic. Acute laryngitis is temporary, common and usually improves once the underlying cause is treated. While some people are more prone to laryngitis, most adults develop the condition once every couple of years.\n  If laryngitis is present longer than three weeks, it’s considered chronic. Research suggests that about 21% of Americans will develop chronic laryngitis at some point in their lives.\n  When you get laryngitis, your vocal cords become, swollen and irritated.

Pharyngitis refers to an inflamed pharynx. It’s the medical term for a sore throat. Your pharynx starts behind your nose and ends just above your voice box. Laryngitis refers to an inflamed larynx, or voice box. Your larynx is near your pharynx, just above your windpipe.\n  When your vocal cords function normally, they open and close smoothly, producing sounds through vibration. However, when your vocal cords are swollen, the sounds that pass through them are distorted. As a result, your voice sounds weak or hoarse.\n  - Have a respiratory infection, such as bronchitis or sinusitis.\n"

Doing whatever you can to calm them down will help.\n  In most cases, a child’s mild croup symptoms can be turned around with simple home remedies.\n  Children with mild croup usually improve in three to seven days.\n  This is different than the wheezing that occurs when a child has difficulty breathing air out of the lungs. Wheezing occurs in asthma, which is a problem in the lungs; stridor occurs in croup, which is a problem in the upper airway.\n  The infection can be associated with nasal congestion, cough, sore throat and fever. Upper airway swelling can cause children to have just a sore throat, or if more severe, can cause distress when breathing in. This type of difficulty breathing results in a high-pitched creaking or whistling sound when a child inhales (known as stridor) and a harsh cough that sounds like a seal’s bark.\n  Symptoms are often worse at night and can wake the child from sleep.\n  Published on in Health Tip of the Week\n"

        "response_text": "PSVT stands for Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia. It is a type of abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia [1][2]. During PSVT, the heartbeats are regular but rapid, ranging from 120 to 230 beats per minute. It starts and stops abruptly, and the heartbeat originates from the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. A short circuit rhythm develops in the atria, which results in rapid heartbeat due to the abnormal electrical pathway made of heart cells that allows electricity to speed around in a circle and repeat the signal over and over, causing chambers to contract. Palpitations or fluttering sensation in the chest are common symptoms of PSVT [1][2]. \n\nThe most common cause of PSVT is Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), followed by Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, and Atrial tachycardia [1]. AVNRT occurs when a small extra pathway exists in or near the AV node, while the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome occurs when there is an extra muscle fiber that connects the upper and lower chambers of the heart [1]. Atrial tachycardia is caused when the electrical impulse fires rapidly from a site outside the sinus node and circles the atria due to a short circuit [1].\n\nTreatment is not always necessary, and the condition isn't usually life-threatening [2]. However, if deemed necessary, providers can treat PSVT with medications, cardiac procedures, or rarely a pacemaker implant [2]. The treatment method varies depending on the underlying cause of PSVT [1].\n\nIn summary, PSVT is a type of arrhythmia caused by abnormal electrical activity that begins in the atria. It can be caused by several conditions, including AVNRT, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and atrial tachycardia [1]. Though not always necessary, treatment options include medication, cardiac procedures, and pacemaker implantation depending on the cause of PSVT [2].",

Symptoms include:\n  Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia. It occurs when a short circuit rhythm develops in the upper chamber of the heart. This results in a regular but rapid heartbeat that starts and stops abruptly.\n  A normal heartbeat begins with an electrical impulse from the sinus node, a small area in the heart's right atrium (upper chamber). PSVT occurs because of a short circuit — an abnormal electrical pathway made of heart cells — that allows electricity to speed around in a circle and repeat the signal over and over. As a result, the chambers contract rapidly, which may impair heart function and cause symptoms such as lightheadedness or shortness of breath.\n  Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common cause of PSVT. It occurs when a small extra pathway exists in or near the AV node — the \"gate\" that sends electricity from the upper chambers (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles). An electrical impulse that enters this pathway will circle rapidly, causing a sudden (paroxysmal), fast heartbeat in both the atria and the ventricles. AVNRT is not a life-threatening arrhythmia, but it can cause symptoms such as lightheadedness or syncope (fainting).\n  Atrial tachycardia is responsible for about 5 percent of PSVTs. It occurs when an electrical impulse fires rapidly from a site outside the sinus node and circles the atria, often due to a short circuit.\n  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome occurs when an extra muscle fiber connects the upper and lower chambers of the heart. In normal hearts, the only connection between the upper and lower chambers is the AV node — the electrical signal passes from the atria, through the AV node, and ends in the ventricles. The presence of this extra path can encourage a \"short circuit\" arrhythmia known as an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). The symptoms of AVRT vary widely from mild heart racing to syncope. Due to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, people with Wolfe-Parkinson White syndrome are advised to have curative catheter ablation.\n  A regular but racing heartbeat of 120 to 230 beats per minute that starts and stops abruptly\n  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is congenital, developing in utero. Although present from birth, the tachycardias (rapid heartbeats) that result from the abnormal electrical connection often take years or decades before they become a problem.\n  Palpitations (a feeling of fluttering in the chest)\n  The short circuit is caused by one of three conditions and will have a different location and behavior depending on the cause.\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22232-paroxysmal-supraventricular-tachycardia-psvt\n  PSVT results from abnormal electrical activity that begins in the atria. This abnormal activity causes the atria to contract (pump) very quickly over and over again. Treatment for PSVT isn’t always required, and the condition isn’t usually life threatening. If necessary, providers can treat this condition with medications, cardiac procedures and rarely a pacemaker implant. See your provider for an evaluation if you notice any irregularities in your heartbeat.\n  Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a general term used to describe a type of arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). Tachycardias are faster-than-normal heartbeats. If you have this condition, your heart may suddenly beat more quickly. Just as suddenly, your heart may slow down and beat at a normal rate. These episodes (also called paroxysms) are triggered by rapid heartbeats originating from the top chambers of your heart called the atria. The two bottom chambers are the ventricles. These four chambers work together to pump blood through your heart and to the rest of your body.\n  A variety of conditions are considered PSVT. These can be caused by multiple connections from the top to the bottom chambers of your heart either directly or through the AV node, resulting in tachycardia. In other circumstances, an irritable focus in the top chambers of your heart could also trigger tachycardia.\n  What are the types of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias?\n  Supraventricular tachycardias are the most common type of arrhythmias in children and babies. They’re more common among children who have heart disease.\n  Heart arrhythmias are very common. Millions of people in the United States live with some type of arrhythmia.\n  The SA node sends electrical signals that cause the atria to contract (pump). The signals travel to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is a little clump of cells in the middle of the heart. The AV node carries the electrical impulses that tell the ventricles to contract.\n  In a heart that works normally, the heartbeat begins in the sinoatrial node (SA node). The SA node is a small mass of tissue in the atria. It serves as the heart’s pacemaker.\n"

Although A-fib itself usually isn't life-threatening, it's a serious medical condition that requires proper treatment to prevent stroke.\n  A person with atrial fibrillation may also have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. Although atrial flutter is a different arrhythmia, the treatment is quite similar to atrial fibrillation.\n  During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly — out of sync with the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart. For many people, A-fib may have no symptoms.

Those who do have atrial fibrillation symptoms may have signs and symptoms such as:\n  In a typical heart, a tiny cluster of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal then travels through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and passes into the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from multiple locations in the atria (typically pulmonary veins), causing them to beat chaotically. Since the atrioventricular (AV) node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the ventricles, the heart beats faster and irregularly.\n  - Sensations of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat (palpitations)\n[3] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16765-atrial-fibrillation-afib\n  Atrial fibrillation (also called Afib or AF) is an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that begins in the upper (atria) of your heart. If you have atrial fibrillation, the normal cycle of electrical impulses in your heart is interrupted. This leads to a fast, chaotic heart rhythm and poor movement of blood from your atria to your lower chambers (ventricles).\n  There are three main types of atrial fibrillation.\n  - Long-standing persistent Afib lasts more than a year and is sometimes difficult to treat.\n  - Paroxysmal Afib lasts less than one week and usually stops on its own without treatment.

That’s why it’s important to learn the symptoms and talk with your healthcare provider about your personal risk factors.\n  You might be wondering what Afib feels like. Some people with Afib have no symptoms. It depends on how fast your ventricles are beating. If they’re beating at a normal or slightly elevated pace, you probably won’t feel anything.

Bronchiectasis can affect one or many sections of both lungs and can lead to serious health problems such as respiratory failure, a collapsed lung, and heart failure [3].\n\nMost people with bronchiectasis live a normal life span by managing their symptoms with their healthcare provider's advice and medication [2]. Early diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis are important to prevent further lung damage. There is currently no cure for bronchiectasis, but with proper care, most people who have it can enjoy a good quality of life[3]. People who are at higher risk of developing bronchiectasis include those living with an underlying condition that affects their lungs or immune system. The risk of developing bronchiectasis increases as people get older, even without an underlying condition [2].\n\nSymptoms of bronchiectasis include coughing, daily production of large amounts of mucus, or phlegm, and repeated serious lung infections that cause more damage to the airways [1][2][3]. Healthcare providers categorize bronchiectasis based on what the damage to the airways looks like - cylindrical, varicose, or cystic.

This injury is the beginning of a cycle in which your airways slowly lose their ability to clear out mucus, resulting in mucus buildup and an environment in which bacteria can grow. This leads to repeated serious lung infections that cause more damage to your airways. Over time, the airways become stretched out, flabby and scarred and unable to move air in and out. Bronchiectasis usually begins in childhood, but symptoms may not appear until months or even years after you have started having repeated lung infections.\n  Daily production of large amounts of mucus, or phlegm\n  Over time, more serious symptoms may develop, including:\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21144-bronchiectasis\n  Bronchiectasis (“bronk-ee-EK-tuh-sis”) is a lung condition where your airways (tubes going into your lungs) get damaged and widen. Damaged airways can’t clear mucus like they're supposed to. Bacteria then grows in the mucus, causing more inflammation and damage to your lungs. This makes you cough a lot as your body tries to remove the infected mucus.\n  Bronchiectasis can be mild or severe depending on how much damage you have in your lungs. Some people have it and don’t even know it. Others have had it for a long time and repeated infections have severely damaged their lungs. Most people with bronchiectasis live a normal life span by manage their symptoms with a provider’s advice and medication.\n  Healthcare providers categorize bronchiectasis based on what the damage to your airways looks like — cylindrical (or tubular), varicose or cystic. Cylindrical bronchiectasis is the most common and least serious form of bronchiectasis. Cystic bronchiectasis is the most severe form.\n  Providers also categorize bronchiectasis as focal (in one area) or diffuse (in many areas throughout your lungs). Traction bronchiectasis happens when scarring in your lungs pulls your airways out of shape.\n  When any part of this system isn’t working — if your cilia are damaged or your airways have pockets that trap mucus — you build up mucus in your lungs. The mucus has bacteria trapped in it, which can multiply and cause infections. The damage the infections causes can make bronchiectasis worse.\n  What’s the difference between bronchiectasis and bronchitis?\n  You’re at higher risk of bronchiectasis if you’re living with an underlying condition that affects your lungs or immune system. Without an underlying condition, your risk increases as you get older.\n  About 350,000 to 500,000 people in the U.S. have bronchiectasis. This includes one person out of 150 people who are 75 and older. The actual number might be higher since you can have bronchiectasis without having any symptoms.\n  Bronchiectasis and bronchitis have similar symptoms, including mucus in your lungs and coughing. But bronchiectasis causes permanent widening of your airways and bronchitis is a temporary infection that doesn’t cause lasting damage.\n  The tubes (airways or bronchi) going into your lungs have defenses to protect you from disease. Annoying as it can sometimes be, mucus is one of these defenses. When mucus can’t be coughed out, it causes lasting damage to your airways.\n  When you breathe air in, any harmful particles get trapped in mucus in your airways. Then, millions of tiny, hairlike structures (cilia) use a coordinated motion to move the mucus out of your lungs, like waves bringing debris to the shore. This is called mucociliary clearance. You cough out the mucus or swallow it, where the trapped particles are destroyed by your stomach acid.\n[3] https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/bronchiectasis\n  Bronchiectasis is a condition that occurs when the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs get damaged, causing them to widen and become loose and scarred. These tubes are called airways.\n  Bronchiectasis usually results from an infection or other condition that injures the walls of your airways or prevents the airways themselves from clearing mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance that the airways produce to help remove inhaled dust, bacteria, and other small particles.\n  Bronchiectasis can affect just one section of one of your lungs or many sections of both lungs. It can lead to serious health problems, such as respiratory failure, a collapsed lung, and heart failure. Currently, bronchiectasis has no cure. However, with proper care, most people who have it can enjoy a good quality of life.\n  In bronchiectasis, your airways slowly lose their ability to clear out this mucus. When mucus can't be cleared, it builds up and creates an environment in which bacteria can grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections.\n  Early diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis is important. The sooner your doctor starts treating bronchiectasis and any underlying conditions, the better your chances of preventing further lung damage.\n  Each infection causes more damage to your airways. Over time, the airways lose their ability to move air in and out. This can make it hard for enough oxygen to reach your vital organs.\n"

Early infections are treatable with the medications benznidazole or nifurtimox, which usually cure the disease if given shortly after the person is infected, but become less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end-stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox often cause side effects, including skin disorders, digestive system irritation, and neurological symptoms, which can result in treatment being discontinued. New drugs for Chagas disease are under development, and experimental vaccines have been studied in animal models, a human vaccine has not been developed.\n  |Causes||Trypanosoma cruzi spread by kissing bugs|\n  |Photomicrograph of Giemsa-stained Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes in human blood|\n  T. cruzi is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the bite of a kissing bug. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, consuming food or drink contaminated with the parasites, and vertical transmission (from a mother to her baby). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope or detecting its DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for T. cruzi in the blood.\n  |Prevention||Eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites|\n  |Diagnostic method||Finding the parasite, its DNA, or antibodies in the blood|\n  |Complications||Heart failure, enlarged esophagus, enlarged colon|\n[2] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212\n  Chagas (CHAH-gus) disease is an inflammatory, infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is found in the feces of the triatomine (reduviid) bug. This bug is also known as the \"kissing bug.\" Chagas disease is common in South America, Central America and Mexico, the primary home of the triatomine bug. Rare cases of Chagas disease have also been found in the southern United States.\n  Chagas disease can cause a sudden, brief illness (acute), or it may be a long-lasting (chronic) condition. Symptoms range from mild to severe, although many people don't experience symptoms until the chronic stage.\n  Also called American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease can infect anyone. Left untreated, Chagas disease later can cause serious heart and digestive problems.\n  The acute phase of Chagas disease, which lasts for weeks or months, is often symptom-free. When signs and symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and may include:\n  During the acute phase of infection, treatment of Chagas disease focuses on killing the parasite. In people who have chronic Chagas disease, it's no longer possible to kill the parasite. Treatment in this later phase is about managing signs and symptoms. You can also take steps to prevent infection.\n  Signs and symptoms that develop during the acute phase usually go away on their own. In some cases, if the infection isn't treated, Chagas disease will advance to the chronic phase.\n"

As a result, your airway becomes temporarily blocked, making it difficult to breathe or speak. Laryngospasms are rare and typically last for fewer than 60 seconds. Even though laryngospasms are scary when they happen, they usually don’t cause serious problems.\n  - Anesthesia. In some cases, laryngospasm occurs during general anesthesia. This happens when the anesthesia or extubation (removal of the nose or throat tube) irritates your vocal cords. This type of laryngospasm is more common in certain individuals, including children, people undergoing surgery on their larynx or pharynx and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n  People with laryngospasm are unable to speak or breathe. Many describe a choking sensation. This is because your vocal cords are contracted and closed tight during a laryngospasm. As your vocal cords slowly relax and open, you may hear a high-pitched sound (stridor). You might experience multiple laryngospasms in a brief time — but in most cases, each episode ends after about a minute. Even though laryngospasm isn’t usually serious or life-threatening, the experience can be terrifying.\n  - Asthma. People with asthma may experience laryngospasm after coming in contact with air pollution or breathing vigorously after exercise.\n  Sometimes, laryngospasm happens for seemingly no reason. But it can be a symptom of other conditions, including:\n  - Laryngeal hypersensitivity (irritable larynx syndrome). If the mucosa of your upper airway is too sensitive, anything that stimulates it may cause a laryngospasm, such as cold air, talking loud, coughing or eating certain foods.\n  - Stress or anxiety disorders. Emotional responses like stress and anxiety can trigger laryngospasm. It’s your body’s physical response to an intense emotion that you’re feeling.\n  - Sleep-related laryngospasm. Some people experience laryngospasm in their sleep and wake up gasping for air. Often, this is related to vocal cord dysfunction or acid reflux.\n  While laryngospasms affect your vocal cords (two bands of tissue housed inside of your larynx), bronchospasms affect your bronchi (the airways that connect your windpipe to your lungs). Both conditions result in sudden, frightening spasms — and both conditions can temporarily affect your ability to breathe and speak.\n  Laryngospasms are rare. Some people may experience recurring (returning) laryngospasms. If this happens to you, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help figure out what’s causing them.\n  - GERD (chronic acid reflux).

This can be a frightening experience as you awake feeling disoriented and having trouble breathing.\n  Laryngospasms can also happen during surgical procedures that involve general anesthesia. This is due to the anesthesia irritating the vocal cords.\n  Laryngospasms are rare and usually last for less than a minute. During that time, you should be able to speak or breathe. They’re not usually an indicator of a serious problem and, generally speaking, they aren’t fatal. You may experience a laryngospasm once and never have one again.\n  Laryngospasms following anesthesia are more often seen in children than in adults. They’re also more likely to occur in people undergoing surgery of the larynx or pharynx. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are also at a higher risk for this surgical complication.\n  If stress or anxiety cause laryngospasms, you may need help from a mental health professional in addition to your regular doctor.\n  If you’re having recurring laryngospasms, they’re probably a symptom of something else.\n  Vocal cord dysfunction is when your vocal cords behave abnormally when you inhale or exhale. Vocal cord dysfunction is similar to asthma, and both can trigger laryngospasms.\n  If you have laryngospasms that recur, you should find out what’s causing them.\n  GERD is characterized by stomach acid or undigested food coming back up your esophagus.

The presence of dyspnea or orthopnea should prompt consideration for congestive heart failure (CHF), whereas heat intolerance, fatigue, and weight loss may suggest Graves disease.5–7\n  Edema is a frequent manifestation of systemic illness resulting in maldistribution of total body water. Total body water is divided into intracellular (two-thirds) and extracellular (one-third) compartments. The extracellular compartment is further divided into plasma (one-fourth) and interstitial fluid (three-fourths). Edema is characterized by excess fluid accumulation in the interstitial compartment and occurs because of an imbalance of capillary hemodynamics as a result of one or more of the following mechanisms: increased oncotic pressure of the interstitial space, increased intravascular hydrostatic pressure, increased permeability of the endothelial barrier, decreased oncotic pressure within the capillary, or poor lymphatic drainage.1,2 Although edema is often localized to the extremities, fluid may also accumulate throughout the entire body (anasarca).2\n  Proximal deep venous thrombosis (e.g., inferior vena cava thrombosis)\n  Trauma (e.g., ruptured muscle, compartment syndrome, fracture)\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/edema/symptoms-causes/syc-20366493\n  Edema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues.

Lupus is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs causing inflammation and damage. Symptoms of SLE vary among individuals and can involve many organs and systems including the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, central nervous system, and blood-forming system [1][2][3]. SLE may first appear as extreme tiredness (fatigue), a vague feeling of discomfort or illness (malaise), fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Most affected individuals also have joint pain, typically affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and muscle pain and weakness. A characteristic feature is a flat red rash across the cheeks and bridge of the nose, called a \"butterfly rash\" because of its shape. [2] SLE can also limit a person's physical, mental, and social functioning and have both short- and long-term effects on a person's life [3]. The causes of SLE are unknown, but are believed to be linked to environmental, genetic, and hormonal factors [3]. Diagnosis may be delayed for years, and the condition may never be diagnosed in some affected individuals. Females develop SLE about nine times more often than males. It is most common in younger women, peaking during the childbearing years; however, 20 percent of SLE cases occur in people over age 50. Researchers suggest that factors such as ethnic mixing, tobacco use in industrialized countries, and the different types of infections people acquire in different regions may contribute to the prevalence differences.

It's what most people mean when they refer to \"lupus\".\n  Symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) vary from person to person and they may come and go and change over time. Lupus shares symptoms with other diseases, which can make it difficult to diagnose. The most common symptoms include:\n  SLE can cause inflammation of multiple organs or organ systems in the body, either acutely or chronically. In contrast, cutaneous lupus (CLE), is limited to the skin, although in some patients, it may eventually progress to SLE. Drug-induced lupus can be caused by certain prescription medications. It has many of the same symptoms as SLE but rarely affects major organs and disappears about six months after the medication is stopped. Neonatal lupus occurs only in newborns and is not true lupus. Most of the symptoms of neonatal lupus will disappear after six months.\n[2] https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/systemic-lupus-erythematosus/\n  SLE may first appear as extreme tiredness (fatigue), a vague feeling of discomfort or illness (malaise), fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Most affected individuals also have joint pain, typically affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and muscle pain and weakness. Skin problems are common in SLE. A characteristic feature is a flat red rash across the cheeks and bridge of the nose, called a \"butterfly rash\" because of its shape. The rash, which generally does not hurt or itch, often appears or becomes more pronounced when exposed to sunlight. Other skin problems that may occur in SLE include calcium deposits under the skin (calcinosis), damaged blood vessels (vasculitis) in the skin, and tiny red spots called petechiae. Petechiae are caused by a shortage of cells involved in clotting (platelets), which leads to bleeding under the skin. Affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia) and open sores (ulcerations) in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose, or, less commonly, the genitals.\n  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation in connective tissues, such as cartilage and the lining of blood vessels, which provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. The signs and symptoms of SLE vary among affected individuals, and can involve many organs and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, central nervous system, and blood-forming (hematopoietic) system. SLE is one of a large group of conditions called autoimmune disorders that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.\n  SLE has been estimated to affect between 322,000 and 1.5 million people in the United States. The exact prevalence is difficult to determine because many of the signs and symptoms of SLE resemble those of other disorders. Diagnosis may be delayed for years, and the condition may never be diagnosed in some affected individuals. Females develop SLE about nine times more often than males. It is most common in younger women, peaking during the childbearing years; however, 20 percent of SLE cases occur in people over age 50.\n  People with SLE have episodes in which the condition gets worse (exacerbations) and other times when it gets better (remissions). Overall, SLE gradually gets worse over time, and damage to the major organs of the body can be life-threatening.\n  For unknown reasons, in industrialized Western countries SLE has become 10 times more common over the past 50 years. The prevalence of SLE in Africa and Asia is believed to be much lower than in Western nations; however, in industrialized Western countries, people of African and Asian descent are two to four times more likely to develop SLE than are people of European descent. Researchers suggest that factors such as ethnic mixing, tobacco use in industrialized countries, and the different types of infections people acquire in different regions may contribute to these differences. For example malaria, which occurs often in tropical regions, is thought to be protective against SLE, while the Epstein-Barr virus, more common in the West, increases SLE risk.\n  A rare, inherited form of SLE follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have disease-causing variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n[3] https://www.cdc.gov/lupus/facts/detailed.html\n  People with SLE may experience a variety of symptoms that include fatigue, skin rashes, fevers, and pain or swelling in the joints. Among some adults, having a period of SLE symptoms—called flares—may happen every so often, sometimes even years apart, and go away at other times—called remission. However, other adults may experience SLE flares more frequently throughout their life.\n  SLE can limit a person’s physical, mental, and social functioning. These limitations experienced by people with SLE can impact their quality of life, especially if they experience fatigue. Fatigue is the most common symptom negatively affecting the quality of life of people with SLE.2,3\n  SLE can affect people of all ages, including children. However, women of childbearing ages—15 to 44 years—are at greatest risk of developing SLE.1 Women of all ages are affected far more than men (estimates range from 4 to 12 women for every 1 man).1\n  The causes of SLE are unknown, but are believed to be linked to environmental, genetic, and hormonal factors.\n  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is the most common type of lupus. SLE is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks its own tissues, causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs. It can affect the joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. There is no cure for lupus, but medical interventions and lifestyle changes can help control it.\n  SLE is diagnosed by a health care provider using symptom assessments, physical examination, X-rays, and lab tests. SLE may be difficult to diagnose because its early signs and symptoms are not specific and can look like signs and symptoms of other diseases.1 SLE may also be misdiagnosed if only a blood test is used for diagnosis. Because diagnosis can be challenging, it is important to see a doctor specializing in rheumatology for a final diagnosis. Rheumatologists sometimes use specific criteria [PDF -510KB] to classify SLE for research purposes.\n  Adherence to treatment regimens is often a problem, especially among young women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years). Because SLE treatment may require the use of strong immunosuppressive medications that can have serious side effects, female patients must stop taking the medication before and during pregnancy to protect unborn children from harm.\n  SLE can have both short- and long-term effects on a person’s life. Early diagnosis and effective treatments can help reduce the damaging effects of SLE and improve the chance to have better function and quality of life. Poor access to care, late diagnosis, less effective treatments, and poor adherence to therapeutic regimens may increase the damaging effects of SLE, causing more complications and an increased risk of death.1\n"

A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage.\n  Active TB disease. Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection.

During a heart attack, tissue in the heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through the heart's arteries.\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21744-unstable-angina\n  How to know if you have stable vs. unstable angina\n  When you have unstable angina, your heart muscle doesn't get as much oxygen-rich blood as it should because of plaque blockages and usually a blood clot in one or more of the arteries that feed your heart (coronary arteries). Unstable angina is a type of angina (chest pain) that often doesn’t have a pattern and usually gets worse. It happens with only mild physical activity or may happen without warning when you’re at rest, relaxing or even asleep.\n  Stable angina is more common than unstable angina in the 10 million Americans who have some type of angina. Estimates say unstable angina occurs in about 200,000 Americans each year. Stable and unstable angina are both more common with older adults, in men and in people who smoke, have diabetes or have high blood pressure. But people without any of these risks can also have unstable angina and should pay attention and act if they are having symptoms.\n  This is a dangerous type of angina that puts you at a big risk of having a heart attack if it’s not quickly treated. Many people who have heart attacks get unstable angina, exhaustion or shortness of breath days or weeks before their heart attack happens.\n  - Occurs with physical activity or with anger, anxiety or stress.\n  Your heart muscle doesn’t get enough blood for as long as the blood clot blocks your coronary artery. In some cases, this can lead to permanent heart muscle damage, a heart attack.\n  - Occurs regularly or predictably — usually with the same amount of activity or emotional stress every time.\n  - Lasts a short amount of time (usually only a few minutes).\n  In rare situations, your heart can stop beating, which is fatal.\n[3] https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/angina-chest-pain/unstable-angina\n  Learn about an unstable form of angina called Prinzmetal angina.\n  Unstable angina should be treated as an emergency. If you have new, worsening or persistent chest discomfort, call 911 and go to the emergency room. You could be having a heart attack, increasing risk for severe cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, which could lead to sudden death.\n  Unstable angina, one of several acute coronary syndromes, causes unexpected chest pain, and usually occurs while resting. The most common cause is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle because the coronary arteries are narrowed by fatty buildups (atherosclerosis) that can rupture, causing injury to the coronary blood vessel. This results in blood clotting, which blocks blood flow to the heart muscle.\n  Blood clots that block an artery partially or totally are what cause unstable angina. Typically, the artery will have plaque buildup (atherosclerosis) that has narrowed the vessel. The plaque may have damaged areas that make it easier for blood clots to form. Angina can occur each time a clot blocks blood flow in an artery. Learn more about excessive blood clotting.\n  Next, based on the extent of the coronary artery blockage(s) your health care team will discuss with the following treatment options with you:\n  - Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be required to open a blocked coronary artery. This procedure involves undergoing cardiac catheterization, followed by using a catheter with a small inflatable balloon at the tip. The balloon is inflated, squeezing open the fatty plaque deposit in the inner lining of the coronary artery. Then, the balloon is deflated and the catheter is withdrawn. This procedure is often followed by insertion of a stent to keep the coronary artery vessel open to allow for improved blood flow to the heart muscle.\n  - May occur while you're resting, sleeping or with little physical exertion.\n  - Usually isn't relieved by rest or medicine.\n  First, your health care team will need to find the blocked part or parts of the coronary arteries by performing a cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, a catheter is guided through an artery in the arm or leg and into the coronary arteries, then injected with a liquid dye through the catheter. High-speed X-ray movies record the course of the dye as it flows through the arteries, and blockages can be identified by tracing the flow. An evaluation of how well your heart is working also can be done during cardiac catheterization.\n  - Coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be necessary depending on the extent of coronary artery blockages and medical history. In this procedure, a blood vessel is used to route blood around the blocked part of the artery.\n"

So, what is it, and what could it mean for you? It’s important to understand the basics.\n  Angina pectoris is the medical term for chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease. It occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get as much blood as it needs. This usually happens because one or more of the heart's arteries is narrowed or blocked, also called ischemia.\n  Angina often occurs when the heart muscle needs more blood than it's getting, such as during physical activity like climbing a hill or stairs, or when you're having strong emotions. Severely narrowed arteries may allow enough blood to reach the heart when the demand for oxygen is low, such as when you're sitting, but angina may also occur at rest.\n  Angina usually causes uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the center of the chest. You may also feel the discomfort in your neck, jaw, shoulder, back or arm. (Many types of chest discomfort — such as heartburn, lung infection or inflammation — aren‘t related to angina.) Angina in women can be different than in men.\n  - Occurs when the heart must work harder, usually during physical exertion.\n  - May feel like chest pain that spreads to the arms, back or other areas.\n  - Doesn't come as a surprise, and episodes of pain tend to be alike.\n  - Usually lasts a short time (5 minutes or less).\n  - Exposure to very hot or cold temperatures – learn how cold and hot weather affect the heart.\n"

Fruit bats are believed to be the natural host of the Ebola virus [2]. Symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after becoming infected with the virus, and includes fever, sore throat, muscle pain, and headaches. These are usually followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and decreased liver and kidney function, leading to internal and external bleeding in some cases. Death can occur between six and 16 days after the first symptoms appear [2]. An Ebola vaccine has been approved for prevention by the US FDA [2][3]. Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement, including rapid detection, contact tracing of those exposed, quick access to laboratory services, and proper disposal of the dead. Prevention measures include wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease, and limiting the spread of the disease from infected animals to humans by wearing protective clothing while handling potentially infected bushmeat, and by cooking bushmeat thoroughly before eating it [2][3].",

There have been no documented cases, either in nature or under laboratory conditions, of the disease spreading through the air between humans or other primates. After a person recovers from Ebola, their semen or breast milk may continue to carry the virus for anywhere between several weeks to several months. Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature; they are able to spread the virus without being affected by it. The symptoms of Ebola may resemble those of several other diseases, including malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Diagnosis is confirmed by testing blood samples for the presence of viral RNA, viral antibodies or the virus itself.\n  The disease was first identified in 1976, in two simultaneous outbreaks: one in Nzara (a town in South Sudan) and the other in Yambuku (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. Ebola outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1976 and 2012, according to the World Health Organization, there were 24 outbreaks of Ebola resulting in a total of 2,387 cases, and 1,590 deaths. The largest Ebola outbreak to date was an epidemic in West Africa from December 2013 to January 2016, with 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths. On 29 March 2016, it was declared to no longer be an emergency. Other outbreaks in Africa began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2017, and 2018. In July 2019, the World Health Organization declared the Congo Ebola outbreak a world health emergency.\n  Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement, including rapid detection, contact tracing of those exposed, quick access to laboratory services, care for those infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with extreme caution. Prevention measures include wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease, and limiting the spread of the disease from infected animals to humans – by wearing protective clothing while handling potentially infected bushmeat, and by cooking bushmeat thoroughly before eating it. An Ebola vaccine was approved by the US FDA in December 2019. While there is no approved treatment for Ebola as of 2019[update], two treatments (atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab and ansuvimab) are associated with improved outcomes. Supportive efforts also improve outcomes. These include oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids, and treating symptoms. In October 2020, atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab (Inmazeb) was approved for medical use in the United States to treat the disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus.\n  |Differential diagnosis||Malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis, other viral haemorrhagic fevers|\n[2] https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease\n  - Blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola\n  The Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness which is often fatal if untreated. EVD first appeared in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku, DRC. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.\n  Ebola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with:\n  - Objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, feces, vomit) from a person sick with Ebola or the body of a person who died from Ebola\n  The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. The outbreak started in Guinea and then moved across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n  The virus family Filoviridae includes three genera: Cuevavirus, Marburgvirus, and Ebolavirus. Within the genus Ebolavirus, six species have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Taï Forest, Reston and Bombali.\n  It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.\n  Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute in the transmission of Ebola.\n  Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVD. This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.\n  Pregnant women who get acute Ebola and recover from the disease may still carry the virus in breastmilk, or in pregnancy related fluids and tissues. This poses a risk of transmission to the baby they carry, and to others. Women who become pregnant after surviving Ebola disease are not at risk of carrying the virus.\n[3] https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/index.html\n  Ebola disease is caused by an infection with one of a group of viruses, known as ebolaviruses, that are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Although Ebola disease is rare, people can get the disease through contact with an infected animal (bat or nonhuman primate) or a sick or dead person infected with an ebolavirus. Learn more about Ebola disease.\n  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Ebola vaccine, ERVEBO®, for the prevention of Ebola disease. ERVEBO vaccine has been found to be safe and protective against only the Zaire ebolavirus species of ebolavirus.\n  This mobile app estimates when a person with Ebola was exposed to the virus. Knowing when someone was exposed to Ebola is essential to establish chains of transmission. CDC in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory designed the app for field staff with variable levels of education and knowledge of the natural disease progression of Ebola.\n"

AOM is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction and can be caused by various bacterial and viral pathogens [1][2]. AOM can be diagnosed clinically via objective findings on physical exam (otoscopy) combined with the patient's history and presenting signs and symptoms. Imaging studies are not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of AOM. Children with middle ear effusion and anatomic damage or evidence of hearing loss or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist [2].\n\nAn AOM diagnosis requires moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane, new onset of otorrhea not caused by otitis externa, or mild bulging of the tympanic membrane associated with recent onset of ear pain (less than 48 hours) or erythema. Treatment of AOM with antibiotics is controversial and dependent on the subtype of otitis media in question. Analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen can be used alone or in combination to achieve effective pain control in patients with otitis media. High-dose amoxicillin is recommended as the first choice for initial antibiotic therapy in children with AOM [1][2].\n\nComplications of otitis media can be serious and include tympanic membrane (TM) perforation, mastoiditis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, meningitis, brain abscess, hearing loss, lateral and cavernous sinus thrombosis, and others [1]. Infection of the middle ear can be a result of decreased immunity due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes, and other immuno-deficiencies [1].\n\nEmploying an interprofessional team approach is recommended when caring for patients with AOM. This approach involves healthcare professionals such as pediatricians, primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and otolaryngologists. The interprofessional team approach emphasizes proper diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and appropriate referral of patients as needed [1]. \n\nIn summary, AOM is a common pediatric diagnosis that can be diagnosed clinically, and antimicrobial treatment is controversial.

Although acute otitis media can occur at any age, it is most commonly seen between the ages of 6 to 24 months. Approximately 80% of all children will experience a case of otitis media during their lifetime, and between 80% and 90% of all children will have otitis media with an effusion before school age. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of acute otitis media and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.\n  Acute otitis media is defined as an infection of the middle ear space. It is a spectrum of diseases that includes acute otitis media (AOM), chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), and otitis media with effusion (OME). Acute otitis media is the second most common pediatric diagnosis in the emergency department, following upper respiratory infections. Although otitis media can occur at any age, it is most commonly seen between the ages of 6 to 24 months.\n  - Describe a patient presentation consistent with acute otitis media and the subsequent evaluation that should be performed.\n  - Explain when imaging studies should be done for a patient with acute otitis media.\n  Treatment of otitis media with antibiotics is controversial and directly related to the subtype of otitis media in question. Without proper treatment, suppurative fluid from the middle ear can extend to the adjacent anatomical locations and result in complications such as tympanic membrane (TM) perforation, mastoiditis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, meningitis, brain abscess, hearing loss, lateral and cavernous sinus thrombosis, and others. This has led to the development of specific guidelines for the treatment of OM. In the United States, the mainstay of treatment for an established diagnosis of AOM is high-dose amoxicillin, and this has been found to be most effective in children under two years of age. Treatment in countries like the Netherlands is initially watchful waiting, and if unresolved, antibiotics are warranted. However, the concept of watchful waiting has not gained full acceptance in the United States and other countries due to the risk of prolonged middle ear fluid and its effect on hearing and speech, as well as the risks of complications discussed earlier. Analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen can be used alone or in combination to achieve effective pain control in patients with otitis media.\n  Infection of the middle ear can be viral, bacterial, or coinfection. The most common bacterial organisms causing otitis media are Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Following the introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccines, the pneumococcal organisms have evolved to non-vaccine serotypes. The most common viral pathogens of otitis media include the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, and picornaviruses.\n  - Employ an interprofessional team approach when caring for patients with acute otitis media.\n  Otitis media is diagnosed clinically via objective findings on physical exam (otoscopy) combined with the patient's history and presenting signs and symptoms. Several diagnostic tools are available such as a pneumatic otoscope, tympanometry, and acoustic reflectometry, to aid in the diagnosis of otitis media. Pneumatic otoscopy is the most reliable and has a higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to plain otoscopy, though tympanometry and other modalities can facilitate diagnosis if pneumatic otoscopy is unavailable.\n  - Decreased immunity due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes, and other immuno-deficiencies\n  StatPearls [Internet].

Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections.\n  The onset of signs and symptoms of ear infection is usually rapid.\n  Because ear infections often clear up on their own, treatment may begin with managing pain and monitoring the problem. Sometimes, antibiotics are used to clear the infection. Some people are prone to having multiple ear infections. This can cause hearing problems and other serious complications.\n  In an ear infection, narrow tubes that run from the middle ear to high in the back of the throat (eustachian tubes) can become swollen and blocked. This can lead to mucus build-up in the middle ear. This mucus can become infected and cause ear infection symptoms.\n  - Fever of 100 F (38 C) or higher\n"

With laryngospasm, your vocal cords suddenly close up when you take a breath, blocking the flow of air into your lungs. This rare condition can be scary, but it usually goes away on its own within one or two minutes.\n  The airways that connect your windpipe to your lungs are called bronchi. Sometimes the muscles that line your bronchi tighten and cause your airways to narrow.

Although no single parameter has been identified to assess exacerbation severity, lung function is a useful method of assessment, with a PEF of 40 percent or less of predicted function indicating a severe attack in patients five years or older.6 The most useful signs for determining the severity of an asthma exacerbation in children younger than five years, or any child unable to perform a PEF, include the use of accessory muscles of respiration, chest wall retractions, tachypnea greater than 60 breaths per minute, cyanosis, and the presence of inspiratory and expiratory wheezing.8 For all patients, pulse oximetry on room air is a useful initial assessment. An oxygen saturation of less than 92 to 94 percent one hour after beginning standard treatment is a strong predictor of the need for hospitalization.6\n  One study of children up to 18 years of age presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma symptoms identified multiple risk factors for a subsequent emergency department visit: age younger than two years, black race or Hispanic ethnicity, persistent asthma, public health insurance, lower asthma quality-of-life scores, and increased use of the health care system during the previous 12 months.3 In adults, variables associated with relapse within eight weeks of an asthma exacerbation include three or more visits for emergent care in the preceding six months, difficulty performing daily activities because of physical health in the preceding four weeks, and patient self-discharge from care within 24 hours of hospital admission without achieving 50 percent predicted peak expiratory flow (PEF).4 However, regular monitoring of PEF does not help predict an asthma exacerbation.5 Other risk factors for developing an asthma exacerbation include allergen triggers (e.g., pets, seasonal allergens, smoke exposure) and improper use of medications (e.g., not using a spacer, improper use of an inhaler or other delivery device).6\n  |An inhaler with a spacer is equivalent to nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults.||A||17, 18||—|\n  |Continuous beta2 agonist administration reduces hospital admissions in patients with severe acute asthma.||A||21||—|\n  |Inhaled anticholinergic medication improves lung function and decreases hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations.||A||24, 25||When multiple doses are used in combination with short-acting beta2 agonists|\n  |Intravenous magnesium sulfate increases lung function and decreases hospitalizations in children with an acute asthma exacerbation.||A||29||—|\n  |The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization.||A||30||Largest effect noted in patients with severe asthma|\n  |Mild||Dyspnea only with activity (assess tachypnea in young children)||PEF ≥ 70 percent of predicted or personal best||Usually treated at home|\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20354268\n  - Severe shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, and coughing or wheezing\n  During an asthma attack, also called an asthma exacerbation, the airways become swollen and inflamed.

Prevention or reduction of severity of subsequent exacerbation episodes is also a goal for many management and prevention strategies. Typical interventions used for the management of COPD exacerbations include corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen. Surprisingly, there is limited evidence for many of these treatments in this population.14 Recently, the role of mucolytics and aminophyllines has been studied based on their mechanism of action to aid in thinning and clearing of mucus and improving dyspnea, respectively.15,16\n  Key Question 4. In adult patients with exacerbations of COPD, what is the comparative effectiveness of different regimens of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids based on type of agents (e.g., broad-spectrum vs. narrow-spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g., intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment?\n  Although much of the literature centers on inpatient treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, most U.S. patients with COPD are managed by primary care physicians.17 Appropriate coordination of care between subspecialists and primary care physicians is important for prevention and management of acute exacerbations of COPD.\n  Key Question 1. In adult patients with exacerbations of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics compared with placebo or standard care?\n  Several nonpharmacologic treatments have also been assessed for management and/or prevention of COPD exacerbations, including pulmonary rehabilitation programs, chest physiotherapy, and nutritional supplements. Chest physiotherapy includes the use of breathing techniques, vibration/percussion of the chest, and autogenic drainage (using breathing to loosen mucus). Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements have also been highlighted as potential therapies for the prevention and management of acute exacerbations of COPD.14\n  The purpose of this guideline is to provide primary care– relevant recommendations for the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The target audience includes family physicians and other primary care clinicians. The target patient population is adults with acute exacerbations of COPD.\n  COPD is characterized by airflow limitation and chronic respiratory symptoms, including cough and shortness of breath. It affects around 15 million people in the United States and costs more than $32 billion annually.1,2 Chronic lower respiratory tract diseases, including COPD, are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the third leading cause of death worldwide.3,4 Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations of symptoms resulting in the need for additional treatment. Acute exacerbations of COPD are generally characterized by increased dyspnea, increased frequency and severity of cough, and potentially increased sputum.5 Patients experiencing acute exacerbations of COPD are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity, lower quality of life, increased hospital admissions, and a progressive decline in lung function.6–13\n  Key Question 3. In adult patients with exacerbations of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of combinations of treatments that are individually effective (based on empirical evidence in stable COPD)?\n  Key Question 2. In adult patients with exacerbations of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of emerging and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies compared with placebo or standard care?\n  In 2019, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published comparative effectiveness review no. 221, Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies in Adult Patients With Exacerbation of COPD: A Systematic Review.18 The systematic review was conducted by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center. The report was published on the AHRQ website, as well as in two additional systematic review articles.14,19\n  The report included studies evaluating the effectiveness of systemic antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. The authors also searched for studies of the effectiveness of combinations of treatments and compared different regimens of antibiotics and corticosteroids. Effectiveness of treatments was stratified by severity of disease where appropriate. The target population was defined as adults who experienced exacerbation events related to COPD. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center worked with key informants and a technical expert panel consisting of stakeholders, including physician and patient representatives. Family physicians served in both groups. The report included the following key questions represented by the analytic framework in Figure 1.18\n  |Strong: AAFP strongly recommends||High confidence in the net benefit for patient-oriented outcomes; most informed patients would choose recommended option||High|\n  The AAFP's Commission on Health of the Public and Science appointed a group to develop the guideline. Members of the guideline development group included physicians with expertise in guideline development, family medicine, internal medicine, and pulmonary medicine, in addition to a consumer representative. This group followed the guideline development process that can be found in the AAFP Clinical Practice Guideline Manual.20 The group reviewed the evidence from the AHRQ evidence report and used a modified version20 of the GRADE21 system to rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome and the overall strength of each recommendation. The strength of recommendation reflects the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects and reflects the degree to which there is evidence of improved patient-oriented health outcomes (Table 1).\n"

Blood clots most often start in the legs and travel up through the right side of the heart and into the lungs. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n  A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. In most cases, the blood clot starts in a deep vein in the leg and travels to the lung. Rarely, the clot forms in a vein in another part of the body. When a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, it's called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n  Pulmonary embolism symptoms can vary greatly, depending on how much of your lung is involved, the size of the clots, and whether you have underlying lung or heart disease.\n  Other symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include:\n  Because one or more clots block blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. However, prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk of death. Taking measures to prevent blood clots in your legs will help protect you against pulmonary embolism.\n  - A cough that may include bloody or blood-streaked mucus\n  - Chest pain. You may feel like you're having a heart attack. The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply. The pain can stop you from being able to take a deep breath. You also may feel it when you cough, bend or lean over.\n  - Shortness of breath. This symptom usually appears suddenly. Trouble catching your breath happens even when resting and gets worse with physical activity.\n  - Fainting. You may pass out if your heart rate or blood pressure drops suddenly. This is called syncope.\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17400-pulmonary-embolism\n  Pulmonary embolism is one of the most common heart and blood vessel diseases in the world. It ranks third behind heart attack and stroke. In the United States, about 350,000 people a year get a PE.\n  What are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism?\n  A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blood clot in the blood vessels of your lung. This happens when a clot in another part of your body (often your leg or arm) moves through the veins to your lung. A PE restricts blood flow to your lungs, lowers oxygen levels in your lungs and increases blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries.\n  Without quick treatment, a pulmonary embolism can cause heart or lung damage and even death.\n  If you have these symptoms, get medical attention right away. Pulmonary embolism is serious but very treatable. Quick treatment greatly reduces the chance of death.\n  What are the warning signs of a pulmonary embolism?\n  The first signs of pulmonary embolism are usually shortness of breath and chest pains that get worse if you exert yourself or take a deep breath. You may cough up bloody mucus.\n  Symptoms of pulmonary embolism vary, depending on the severity of the clot. Although most people with a pulmonary embolism experience symptoms, some don’t.\n  With proper diagnosis and treatment, a PE is seldom fatal. However, an untreated PE can be serious, leading to other medical complications, including death. About 33% of people with a pulmonary embolism die before they get a diagnosis and treatment.\n  - Be life-threatening, depending on the size of the clot.\n[3] https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pulmonary-embolism\n  A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blood clot that develops in a blood vessel in the body (often in the leg). It then travels to a lung artery where it suddenly blocks blood flow.\n  Who is at risk for a pulmonary embolism?\n  Other less frequent sources of pulmonary embolism are a fat embolus (often linked to the breaking of a large bone), amniotic fluid embolus, air bubbles, and a deep vein thrombosis in the upper body. Clots may also form on the end of an indwelling intravenous (IV) catheter, break off, and travel to the lungs.\n  Venous clots most often happen in the deep veins of the legs. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Once a clot has formed in the deep veins of the leg, there is a potential for part of the clot to break off and travel through the blood to another area of the body, often the lung. DVT is the most common cause of a pulmonary embolism.\n  A blood clot that forms in a blood vessel in one area of the body, breaks off, and travels to another area of the body in the blood is called an embolus. An embolus can lodge itself in a blood vessel. This can block the blood supply to a particular organ. This blockage of a blood vessel by an embolus is called an embolism.\n  Genetic conditions that increase the risk of blood clot formation\n  Blood clots can form in arteries and veins. Clots formed in veins are called venous clots. Veins of the legs can be superficial veins (close to the surface of the skin) or deep veins (located near the bone and surrounded by muscle).\n  When blood clots in a vein, it may be due to the slowed blood flow, an abnormality in clot forming, or from an injury to the blood vessel wall.\n  Surgery or injury (especially to the legs) or orthopedic surgery\n  Blood clotting is a normal process to prevent bleeding. The body makes blood clots and then breaks them down. Under certain circumstances, the body may be unable to break down a clot. This may result in a serious health problem.\n  The heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins make up the body's circulatory system. Blood is pumped with great force from the heart into the arteries. From there blood flows into the capillaries (tiny blood vessels in the tissues). Blood returns to the heart through the veins. As it moves through the veins back to the heart, blood flow slows. Sometimes this slower blood flow may lead to clot formation.\n"

This commonly includes nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold. Most infections are viral in nature, and in other instances, the cause is bacterial. URTIs can also be fungal or helminthic in origin, but these are less common.\n  In uncomplicated colds, coughing and nasal discharge may persist for 14 days or more even after other symptoms have resolved. Acute URTIs include rhinitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and laryngitis often referred to as a common cold, and their complications: sinusitis, ear infection, and sometimes bronchitis (though bronchi are generally classified as part of the lower respiratory tract.) Symptoms of URTIs commonly include cough, sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, headache, low-grade fever, facial pressure, and sneezing.\n  |Sore throat||Sometimes (post-nasal drip)||Very common||Sometimes|\n  |Itchy, watery eyes||Common||Rare (conjunctivitis may occur with adenovirus)||Soreness behind eyes, sometimes conjunctivitis|\n  In terms of pathophysiology, rhinovirus infection resembles the immune response. The viruses do not cause damage to the cells of the upper respiratory tract, but rather cause changes in the tight junctions of epithelial cells. This allows the virus to gain access to tissues under the epithelial cells and initiate the innate and adaptive immune responses.\n  Symptoms of rhinovirus in children usually begin 1–3 days after exposure. The illness usually lasts 7–10 more days.\n  Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis (strep throat) typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, pain with swallowing, and fever. Strep throat does not usually cause a runny nose, voice changes, or cough.[citation needed]\n  Up to 15% of acute pharyngitis cases may be caused by bacteria, most commonly Streptococcus pyogenes, a group A streptococcus in streptococcal pharyngitis (\"strep throat\"). Other bacterial causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordetella pertussis, and Bacillus anthracis[citation needed].\n[2] https://www.medicinenet.com/upper_respiratory_infection/article.htm\n  The URTI is generally caused by the direct invasion of the inner lining (mucosa or mucus membrane) of the upper airway by the culprit virus or bacteria. In order for the pathogens (viruses and bacteria) to invade the mucus membrane of the upper airways, they have to fight through several physical and immunologic barriers.\n  Although upper respiratory infections can happen at any time, they are most common in the fall and winter months, from September until March. This may be explained because these are the usual school months when children and adolescents spend a lot of time in groups and inside closed doors. Furthermore, many viruses of upper respiratory infection thrive in the low humidity of the winter.\n  Upper respiratory infections are one of the most frequent causes for a doctor visit with varying symptoms ranging from a runny nose, sore throat, cough, to breathing difficulty, and lethargy. In the United States, upper respiratory infections are the most common illness leading to missing school or work.\n  It is also important to note that different pathogens have varying abilities to overcome the body's defense system and cause infections.\n  The common cold refers to a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Characteristic symptoms of the common cold include\n  The common cold refers to a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Characteristic symptoms of the common cold include\n  Infection of the specific areas of the upper respiratory tract can be named specifically. Examples of these may include rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal cavity), sinus infection (sinusitis or rhinosinusitis) -- inflammation of the sinuses located around the nose, common cold (nasopharyngitis) -- inflammation of the nares, pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils, pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, uvula, and tonsils), epiglottitis (inflammation of the upper portion of the larynx or the epiglottis), laryngitis (inflammation of the larynx), laryngotracheitis (inflammation of the larynx and the trachea), and tracheitis (inflammation of the trachea).\n  A majority of upper respiratory infections are due to self-limited viral infections. Occasionally, bacterial infections may cause upper respiratory infections. Most often, upper respiratory infection is contagious and can spread from person to person by inhaling respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. The transmission of respiratory infections can also occur by touching the nose or mouth by hand or other objects exposed to the virus.\n  The upper respiratory tract includes the sinuses, nasal passages, pharynx, and larynx. These structures direct the air we breathe from the outside to the trachea and eventually to the lungs for respiration to take place.\n  The hair in the lining of the nose acts as a physical barrier and can potentially trap the invading organisms. Additionally, the wet mucus inside the nasal cavity can engulf the viruses and bacteria that enter the upper airways. There are also small hair-like structures (cilia) that line the trachea which constantly moves any foreign invaders up towards the pharynx to be eventually swallowed into the digestive tract and into the stomach.\n  In addition to these intense physical barriers in the upper respiratory tract, the immune system also does its part to fight the invasion of the pathogens or microbes entering the upper airway. Adenoids and tonsils located in the upper respiratory tract are a part of the immune system that helps fight infections. Through the actions of the specialized cells, antibodies, and chemicals within these lymph nodes, invading microbes are engulfed within them and are eventually destroyed.\n  Despite these defense processes, invading viruses and bacteria adopt various mechanisms to resist destruction. They can sometimes produce toxins to impair the body's defense system or change their shape or outer structural proteins to disguise from being recognized by the immune systems (change of antigenicity). Some bacteria may produce adhesion factors that allow them to stick to the mucus membrane and hinder their destruction.\n"

The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.\n  Who is most likely to get sick with flu?\n  Flu virus infection is very common, and the number of people infected each season can only be estimated because not everyone will seek medical care or get tested. Statistical estimations are based on CDC-measured flu hospitalization rates that are adjusted to estimate the total number of flu virus infections in the United States for a given flu season.\n  The estimates for the number of flu virus infections are then divided by the census population to estimate how common flu virus infections are in the population (called seasonal incidence or attack rate).\n  More information is available at Flu and COVID-19 symptoms.\n  Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.\n  The same CID study found that children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely to get sick from flu. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older. This means that children younger than 18 are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic flu virus infection than adults 65 and older.\n  A 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of the U.S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8 percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3 percent and 11 percent, depending on the season.\n  *It’s important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\n  - some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\n[3] https://www.cdc.gov/Flu/Index.htm\n  Understand who is at higher risk of flu.\n  Flu can cause mild to severe illness.

If a culture of antral fluid was positive for bacteria, the patient was deemed to have acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (about one-third of all patients). Of those with a low risk based on the clinical prediction rule (score of −1 to 3 points), 16% had acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, whereas of those with moderate risk (4 to 6 points) or high risk (7 to 8 points), 49% and 73% had acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, respectively.9 About one-third of patients with acute rhinosinusitis have a bacterial cause.10\n  A 2018 Cochrane review demonstrated that the potential benefit of antibiotics for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis, diagnosed clinically or confirmed with imaging, is marginal.5 Without antibiotics, rhinosinusitis resolved in 46% of patients after one week and in 64% of patients after 14 days.5 Antibiotics can shorten time to resolution but in only five to 11 more people per 100 compared with placebo or no treatment.5 Despite this, approximately 86% of U.S. ambulatory visits for acute rhinosinusitis result in oral antibiotic prescriptions.1 In Europe, antibiotic prescription rates for acute rhinosinusitis in primary care range from 72% to 92%.6\n[2] https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2011/0501/p1057.html\n  |Mild rhinosinusitis symptoms of less than seven days' duration can be managed with supportive care, including analgesics, short-term decongestants, saline nasal irrigation, and intranasal corticosteroids.||A||1, 18, 31|\n  Inflammation of the sinuses rarely occurs without concurrent inflammation of the nasal mucosa; therefore, rhinosinusitis is a more accurate term for what is commonly called sinusitis. The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery defines subtypes of rhinosinusitis based on the duration of symptoms: acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic (Table 1).1,3,4 Acute rhinosinusitis is further categorized as bacterial or viral.\n  Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections associated with the common cold. Mucosal edema leads to obstruction of the sinus ostia. In addition, viral and bacterial infections impair the cilia, which transport mucus. The obstruction and slowed mucus transport cause stagnation of secretions and lowered oxygen tension within the sinuses. This environment is an excellent culture medium for viruses and bacteria. The most common bacterial organisms in community-acquired acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis.5 The most common viruses in acute viral rhinosinusitis are rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus.\n  The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infection are similar, which can lead to overdiagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The presence of purulent nasal drainage is not the sole criterion to distinguish between viral and bacterial infection1,6; the pattern and duration of illness are also key. In most patients, viral rhinosinusitis improves in seven to 10 days. Diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis requires that symptoms persist for longer than 10 days or worsen after five to seven days.1,3,5,7\n  |Antibiotic therapy is recommended for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that do not improve within seven days or that worsen at any time; those with moderate illness (moderate to severe pain or temperature ≥ 101°F [38.3°C]); or those who are immunocompromised.||B||1, 11–13|\n  |Radiographic imaging in patients with acute rhinosinusitis is not recommended unless a complication or an alternative diagnosis is suspected.||C||1, 9, 10|\n  |Amoxicillin is considered the first-line antibiotic for most patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.||A||1, 13|\n  The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery and the American College of Physicians have proposed diagnostic criteria for sinusitis.1,2,5,8 The American College of Physicians' criteria were endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.

In the United States, chronic rhinosinusitis has an estimated prevalence of 1% to 5%. It is a readily treatable disease that is responsible for direct and indirect health care expenses totaling billions of dollars every year in the United States.1,2 Because the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis in children is distinct from that in adults, and the medical and surgical approach differs significantly between children and adults,3 this review focuses on adult chronic rhinosinusitis.\n  Chronic rhinosinusitis is diagnosed clinically with a physical examination and focused sinonasal history, including chronic rhinosinusitis–associated comorbidities and a pertinent family history. Clinical consensus guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery define chronic rhinosinusitis as the presence of at least two out of four cardinal symptoms (i.e., facial pain/pressure, hyposmia/anosmia, nasal obstruction, and nasal drainage) for at least 12 consecutive weeks, in addition to objective evidence on physical examination (anterior rhinoscopy or endoscopy) or radiography, such as computed tomography (CT; Table 1).18 Objective evidence of chronic rhinosinusitis was added as a diagnostic criterion because although the presence of symptoms is sensitive for diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis, it is not specific.18 Of the four cardinal symptoms used for diagnosis, nasal obstruction is most common (81% to 95% of patients), followed by facial pressure (70% to 85%), discolored nasal drainage (51% to 83%), and hyposmia (61% to 69%).18\n  There is increasing evidence that chronic rhinosinusitis is an inflammatory disease and not an infectious process.11,12 Consistent with its underlying inflammatory etiologies, chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with other inflammatory diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma.13–15 Moreover, specific inflammatory and immunodeficiency conditions may rarely cause chronic rhinosinusitis, although symptoms that are not typical of chronic rhinosinusitis may also be present.16 For example, granulomatous diseases such as vasculitis and sarcoidosis can cause chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal symptoms such as nasal crusting and epistaxis. Notably, chronic sinonasal symptoms are the most common presentation of several forms of vasculitis, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.17 Patients with chronic, recurrent sinus infections due to immunodeficiency and poor mucociliary clearance (e.g., cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia) may develop concurrent chronic rhinosinusitis.16\n  Chronic rhinosinusitis may also exacerbate comorbid pulmonary diseases. Bacterial flora from the paranasal sinuses of patients with cystic fibrosis, who almost always develop chronic rhinosinusitis, can serve as a reservoir for seeding pulmonary infections.5 In persons with asthma, comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with poor asthma control, as well as more asthma-related emergency department visits and systemic corticosteroid use.6–8 The greatest impact of chronic rhinosinusitis is decreased quality of life through burdensome chronic sinonasal symptoms and acute exacerbations.9,10\n  |The diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis is based on the presence of at least two out of four cardinal symptoms for at least 12 weeks, in addition to objective evidence on physical examination or radiography.||C||18|\n  |Oral antibiotics, given for up to three weeks, may be considered as a treatment option for acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis.||C||31, 32|\n  Orbital and intracranial complications are the most serious sequelae of chronic rhinosinusitis but are extremely rare, usually arising in patients with superimposed acute sinusitis.

Sinus CT is safe—the average radiation from a scan is equivalent to four months of typical background radiation exposure from living on Earth (less than 1 mSv).19,21\n  |Short courses (up to three weeks) of oral corticosteroids, alone or as an adjunct to standard maintenance therapy, improve sinonasal symptoms in the short term in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and polyps.||A||45, 46|\n  |Do not order more than one CT scan of the paranasal sinuses within 90 days to evaluate uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis when the paranasal sinus CT obtained is of adequate quality and resolution to be interpreted by the clinician and used for clinical decision making and/or surgical planning.||American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation|\n  Physical examination is necessary to establish objective evidence of the diagnosis and should include inspection of the nasal cavity using anterior rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopy when available18 (Figure 1A). In the primary care setting, anterior rhinoscopy is easily performed with an otoscope or a nasal speculum and a headlight. The presence of nasal drainage, particularly mucopurulent drainage, should be assessed using anterior rhinoscopy. Patency of the nasal airway should also be evaluated by assessing for septal deviation and inferior or middle turbinate enlargement; polyps (Figure 1B) or other masses should be ruled out.18 When in doubt, patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist for nasal endoscopy. This procedure has the added benefits of magnification, better anatomic assessment of the nasal cavity and structures, and improved visualization of mucopurulence or polyps arising specifically from the paranasal sinuses.\n[2] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-sinusitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351661\n  Chronic sinusitis occurs when the spaces inside your nose and head (sinuses) are swollen and inflamed for three months or longer, despite treatment.\n  Chronic sinusitis can be brought on by an infection, by growths in the sinuses (nasal polyps) or by swelling of the lining of your sinuses.

Children with severe symptoms, such as struggling to breathe or turning blue, require immediate medical attention [1][3]. Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which affects the larger airways (the bronchi) of the lungs [1][2].

It occurs most often in children under age 2 during winter and early spring. Very rarely, adults can get bronchiolitis.\n  What are the signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis?\n  The viruses that cause most cases of bronchiolitis are the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the rhinovirus and the influenza (flu) virus. These viruses are very contagious and are spread from person to person by touching secretions from the mouth or nose or by respiratory droplets in the air. The droplets get into the air when someone sneezes or coughs.\n  Signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis resemble those of colds and flu. They include:\n  What’s the difference between bronchiolitis and bronchitis?\n  - Wheezing. This might be the first time that your child has wheezing. In bronchiolitis, this follows 3 days or so of the first three symptoms.\n  These two conditions not only sound similar, but they are similar in some ways. Both can be caused by a virus. Both affect the airways in the lungs, but bronchitis affects the larger airways (the bronchi). Bronchiolitis affects the smaller airways (bronchioles). Bronchitis usually affects older children and adults, while bronchiolitis is more common in younger children.\n  For instance, there is a condition called bronchiolitis obliterans, which is sometimes known as “popcorn lung.” This condition is usually caused by breathing in irritating chemicals or other substances.\n  Your child might show more severe signs, including:\n  - Trying so hard to breathe that their chest retracts (the skin is drawn down tightly against the rib cage and looks like it is going inward).\n[2] https://www.healthline.com/health/bronchiolitis\n  Bronchiolitis is a viral lung infection that causes inflammation in the smallest air passages in your lungs called bronchioles. Although it’s generally a childhood condition, bronchiolitis can also affect adults.\n  Read on to learn more about bronchiolitis including symptoms, causes, and treatment options.\n  According to the American Lung Association, the initial symptoms of bronchiolitis often mimic common cold symptoms. They may include:\n  Most cases of viral bronchiolitis are due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Viral outbreaks occur\n  Bronchitis is an infection of your bronchi. Bronchiolitis is an infection of the smaller bronchioles.\n  Bronchiolitis and bronchitis are both viral infections of your lungs, but they affect different structures.\n  Inflammation of your bronchioles can cause a blockage of oxygen in your airways that leads to symptoms such as coughing or trouble breathing. Bronchiolitis generally causes mild illness, but serious cases can progress to lung failure.\n  Bronchiolitis obliterans, or popcorn lung, is a rare and dangerous condition seen in adults caused by severe lung infections or chronic exposure to toxins in the air such as formaldehyde, ammonia, or metal oxide fumes. This disease causes scarring in the bronchioles. Scarring blocks air passages and causes airway obstruction that can’t be reversed.\n  When you breathe in air, it travels from your windpipe to the main passage in each of your lungs called the primary bronchi. From there, air passes through smaller bronchi and then to even smaller passages called bronchioles.\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bronchiolitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351565\n  Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in young children and infants. It causes swelling and irritation and a buildup of mucus in the small airways of the lung. These small airways are called bronchioles. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus.\n  Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms much like a common cold. But then it gets worse, causing coughing and a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out called wheezing. Sometimes children have trouble breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for 1 to 2 weeks but occasionally can last longer.\n  If symptoms become serious, call your child's health care provider. This is especially important if your child is younger than 12 weeks old or has other risk factors for bronchiolitis — for example, being born too early, also called premature, or having a heart condition.\n  For the first few days, the symptoms of bronchiolitis are much like a cold:\n  Many infants with bronchiolitis also have an ear infection called otitis media.\n  Later, your child may have a week or more of working harder than usual to breathe, which may include wheezing.\n  In your lungs, the main airways, called bronchi, branch off into smaller and smaller passageways. The smallest airways, called bronchioles, lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli.\n  - Struggles to breathe and can't speak or cry.\n  Get medical attention right away if your child has any of these symptoms:\n  Most children get better with care at home.

In most cases, a STEMI heart attack happens because of a total blockage of one of the main coronary arteries that provide blood flow to your heart muscle. People with symptoms of heart attack who don’t have ST elevation could have an NSTEMI, which usually happens because of a partial coronary artery blockage or blockage in a branch off of your main coronary artery. Some electrical pattern changes are often visible with NSTEMI, but they’re often not as distinctive, making other tests much more important in diagnosing NSTEMI.\n  Any heart attack, including an NSTEMI, is a life-threatening medical emergency and needs care immediately. If you or someone you’re with appears to be having a heart attack, call 911 (or the local emergency services number for your area) right away. Delaying medical care can be extremely dangerous and can lead to permanent heart damage or death.\n  A non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is a type of heart attack that happens when a part of your heart is not getting enough oxygen. This condition gets its name because — unlike an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI heart attack) — it doesn’t cause a very specific, recognizable change to your heart’s electrical activity.\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22068-stemi-heart-attack\n  STEMI is one of three conditions that fall under acute coronary syndrome, a disease that happens because of limited or no blood flow to a part of your heart. The other two conditions are non-ST elevation heart attacks (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (sudden chest pain, usually while resting, caused by limited blood flow to the heart).\n  An ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a type of heart attack that is more serious and has a greater risk of serious complications and death. It gets its name from how it mainly affects the heart’s lower chambers and changes how electrical current travels through them.\n  A STEMI is a myocardial infarction that causes a distinct pattern on an electrocardiogram (abbreviated either as ECG or EKG). This is a medical test that uses several sensors (usually 10) attached to your skin that can detect your heart’s electrical activity. That activity is then displayed as a wave pattern on a paper readout or a digital display. The different parts of the wave are labeled using letters, starting at P and ending at U.\n  What happens before and during a STEMI heart attack?\n  Among heart attacks, STEMIs are typically more severe. Between 2.5% and 10% of people who have one die within 30 days.\n  When there’s an elevation in the ST segment, that often means there’s a total blockage of one of the heart's main supply arteries. When that is happening during a heart attack, it can be a sign that the muscle of the ventricles is dying. That’s critical information for healthcare providers to know during a STEMI because it means the heart muscle is in the process of dying. That also means reopening that artery and restoring blood flow as soon as possible may prevent permanent damage, or at least limit the severity of the damage.\n  That’s dangerous because the ventricles are the chambers of your heart that pump blood to your lungs and body. If there’s too much damage to the muscle in the ventricles, your heart can’t pump enough blood to support your body. That’s why STEMIs are so dangerous and why restoring blood flow quickly is so critical.\n  To best understand ST-elevation, it helps to know about two specific wave sections:\n  - ST-segment: This is a short section immediately after the QRS complex. Normally, there shouldn’t be any electrical activity in that segment, causing it to be flat and back to baseline.\n  Once blood flow is partially or totally blocked, it causes ischemia (iss-key-me-uh). This is the medical term for how your cells and tissues start to die because they aren't getting blood flow. During a heart attack, the loss of blood flow causes the muscle in your ventricles to begin to die. If too much heart muscle sustains damage, your heart may not have the ability to supply enough blood to your body. That leads to a condition known as cardiogenic shock, which is often fatal. Also, ischemia of the heart muscle may also trigger a dangerous electrical rhythm known as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrest (where your heart stops entirely) and sudden death.\n[3] https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/coronary-artery-disease/acute-myocardial-infarction-mi\n  Acute MI, along with unstable angina, is considered an acute coronary syndrome Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.

Granulomas are surrounded by fibrous (dense) tissue, which makes them feel hard and lumpy.\n[2] https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sarcoidosis\n  Sarcoidosis is a condition that develops when groups of cells in your immune system form red and swollen (inflamed) lumps, called granulomas, in various organs in the body. The caused either by infections or by certain things you come into contact with in your environment.that leads to these granulomas can be\n  Sarcoidosis can affect any organ. Most often it affects the lungs and lymph nodes in the chest. You may feel extremely tired or have a fever. You may also have other symptoms depending on what organ is affected. Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis in part by ruling out other diseases that have similar symptoms.\n  Not everyone needs treatment. Treatment will depend on your symptoms and which organs are affected. Medicines can help treat the inflammation or lower your body’s immune response. Many people recover with few or no long-term problems. Sometimes the disease causes permanent scarring (fibrosis) in the lungs or other organs and can lead to life-threatening heart or lung problems.\n"

Islet cell carcinoma is another name for an NET.\n  There are two main types of pancreatic tumors:\n  Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas mutate (change) and multiply out of control, forming a tumor. Your pancreas is a gland in your abdomen (belly), between your spine and stomach. It makes hormones that control blood-sugar levels and enzymes that aid in digestion.\n  - Exocrine tumors: Over 90% of all pancreatic tumors are exocrine tumors. The most common type of pancreatic cancer is adenocarcinoma, which begins in the cells that line your organs.\n  Early-stage pancreatic tumors don’t show up on imaging tests. For this reason, many people don’t receive a diagnosis until the cancer has spread (metastasis). Pancreatic cancer is also resistant to many common cancer drugs, making it notoriously difficult to treat.\n  Pancreatic cancer is responsible for approximately 3% of all cancers in the United States. It’s the 10th most common cancer in men and people assigned male at birth, and the 8th most common cancer in women and people assigned female at birth.\n  Most pancreatic cancers start in the ducts of your pancreas. The main pancreatic duct (the duct of Wirsung) connects your pancreas to your common bile duct.\n  Cases of pancreatic cancer are on the rise. Trends indicate that pancreatic cancer will be the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States by 2030.\n  Unfortunately, there aren’t any early signs of pancreatic cancer. Symptoms typically emerge once the tumor starts impacting other organs in your digestive system.\n[2] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421\n  Hi. I'm Dr. Chee-Chee Stucky, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of pancreatic cancer: What is it? Who gets it? What are the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment? Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Understanding pancreatic cancer starts with understanding the pancreas. This small, fish-shaped organ sits behind the stomach, producing enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that regulate blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer typically starts in the ducts of the pancreas. Small changes in the cellular DNA result in uncontrolled multiplication and accumulation of cells in clusters called tumors. If untreated, these cancer cells can spread outside of the pancreas to other parts of the body.\n  Unfortunately, we don't usually see the signs of pancreatic cancer until it's in more advanced stages. When present, symptoms may include: Abdominal pain that radiates to the back. A loss of appetite or unintentional weight loss. Jaundice, which is the yellowing of your skin or eyes. Light colored stools. Dark colored urine. Particularly itchy skin. Diabetes that's becoming unusually difficult to control. Blood clots or fatigue.\n  While anyone can get pancreatic cancer, there are certain risk factors to be aware of. Most pancreatic cancer is diagnosed after age 65. Smoking, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas, family history of pancreatic cancer, and certain genetic syndromes are all known risk factors. Carrying extra weight that is unhealthy for your body may also be a contributing factor. New research has found that the specific combination of smoking, diabetes and poor diet increases the risk of pancreatic cancer the most beyond any one factor alone.\n  If your doctors think you may have pancreatic cancer, they may recommend one or more diagnostic tests. For instance, imaging tests like an ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, or PET scan, can help your doctor see a clearer picture of your internal organs. An endoscopic ultrasound, or EUS, is when the doctor passes a tiny camera down the esophagus and into the stomach to get a close-up view of the pancreas. During the EUS, the doctor might collect a biopsy of the tissue for further testing. Sometimes pancreatic cancer can shed specific proteins called tumor markers in your blood. So your doctors may request blood tests to identify elevation of these markers, one of which is called CA 19-9. If a diagnosis is confirmed, the next step is to determine the extent or stage of the cancer. The stages are numbered one through four and may need to be determined by additional testing. Feel free to ask lots of questions during this process. Or get a second opinion to feel the most confident and empowered moving into treatment.\n  When recommending treatment for pancreatic cancer, your doctor is considering many factors, including your overall health and personal preferences. They may recommend one or a combination of the following treatments: Chemotherapy uses drugs that release chemicals that enter the body and kill cancerous cells that may be throughout. Radiation, similarly kills the cancer cells, but with high-energy beams directed at the tumor. Surgery is used to physically remove the cancer and the immediate surrounding area. Ask your doctor if you qualify for clinical trials that test new treatments. And lastly, there is palliative care. This care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other trained professionals who specialize in providing much needed relief from the pain and unpleasant symptoms of a serious illness.\n"

        "response_text": "Acute pulmonary edema is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment [1]. It is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The most common cause of acute pulmonary edema is heart failure, but it can also be caused by other factors such as pneumonia, exposure to toxins, trauma to the chest wall, and high altitude. Symptoms of acute pulmonary edema include coughing up frothy sputum with blood, feeling like you are suffocating or drowning, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing while lying down [1][2][3].\n\nTreatment for acute pulmonary edema depends on the underlying cause but commonly includes oxygen therapy and medications to help remove excess fluid from the lungs [1][2][3]. If the cause is heart-related, treatment may include medications to help regulate the heart's rhythm and blood pressure. In addition to immediate medical care, lifestyle changes and long-term management may be necessary for proper management of acute pulmonary edema [1]. \n\nGiven the seriousness of acute pulmonary edema, it is crucial to seek prompt medical attention if you or someone you know is exhibiting symptoms. An interprofessional team, including emergency medical providers, critical care specialists, and cardiologists, may be involved in treating acute pulmonary edema [3].",

Pulmonary edema can sometimes cause death. Prompt treatment might help. Treatment for pulmonary edema depends on the cause but generally includes additional oxygen and medications.\n  Long-term (chronic) pulmonary edema signs and symptoms\n  Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by too much fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the many air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.\n  Pulmonary edema symptoms may appear suddenly or develop over time. Symptoms depend on the type of pulmonary edema.\n  In most cases, heart problems cause pulmonary edema. But fluid can collect in the lungs for other reasons. These include pneumonia, contact with certain toxins, medications, trauma to the chest wall, and traveling to or exercising at high elevations.\n  - A cough that produces frothy sputum that may have blood in it\n  - Awakening at night with a cough or breathless feeling that may be relieved by sitting up\n  - A feeling of suffocating or drowning that worsens when lying down\n  - Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) or extreme shortness of breath that worsens with activity or when lying down\n[2] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24218-pulmonary-edema\n  Pulmonary edema is the abnormal buildup of “fluid in the lungs.” Fluid buildup in your lungs can lead to shortness of breath, coughing up of foam and loose mucus, wheezing, chest tightness and difficulty breathing. Pulmonary edema can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical treatment.\n  Congestive heart failure that leads to pulmonary edema can be from:\n  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema means fluid backs up in your lungs from a heart problem. The most common cause of cardiogenic pulmonary edema is congestive heart failure. When the left side of your heart stops pumping blood correctly, the blood backs up into the blood vessels in your lungs. As the pressure in your blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air sacs in your lungs.\n  The causes of pulmonary edema can be broken down into two groups: cardiogenic (heart-related) or noncardiogenic (not heart-related).\n  What’s the difference between pulmonary edema and pneumonia?\n  Immersion pulmonary edema is sometimes called swimming-induced pulmonary edema. It occurs when competitive swimmers and divers develop lung injuries because their lung capillaries burst. During diving, blood is sent to your lungs from your legs and abdomen. That excess blood increases pressure in the blood vessels of your lungs. The vessels leak, and the fluid goes into your air sacs.\n  What’s the difference between pulmonary edema and pleural effusion?\n  Both pulmonary edema and pneumonia involve a buildup of fluid in your lungs. An infection causes pneumonia. The infection can be viral, bacterial or fungal. These organisms can cause infected fluid to fill your air sacs. An infection doesn’t cause pulmonary edema, and the fluid is typically thinner and watery.\n  High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) occurs when you’re at high altitudes or if you’re rapidly going up (ascending) a mountain. HAPE is a severe form of altitude sickness (also known as mountain sickness), which occurs because oxygen levels are lower at higher altitudes.\n  Pleural effusion is when abnormal amounts of fluid buildup outside of your lungs in the pleura, which is a lining around your lungs. The pleura sits between your lungs and the inside of your chest wall, and usually only has a thin rim of fluid inside it. Pleural effusion is commonly caused by pneumonia, congestive heart failure or cancer. Unlike pulmonary edema, the fluid sits outside of your lungs and can compress your lungs, which are spongy.\n  HAPE can make you tired, weak, achy and short of breath. It can cause coughing and chest tightness. HAPE is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening. If you have HAPE, you need to go down (descend) immediately and receive medical treatment.\n[3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557611/\n  Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by lung injury with a resultant increase in pulmonary vascular permeability leading to the movement of fluid, rich in proteins, to the alveolar and interstitial compartments. Acute lung injury with severe hypoxemia is referred to as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is seen in various conditions directly affecting the lungs, such as pneumonia, inhalational injury, or indirectly, such as sepsis, acute pancreatitis, severe trauma with shock, multiple blood transfusions.\n  - Outline the signs and symptoms of different types of pulmonary edema.\n  Pulmonary edema can be defined as an abnormal accumulation of extravascular fluid in the lung parenchyma. This process leads to diminished gas exchange at the alveolar level, progressing to potentially causing respiratory failure. Its etiology is either due to a cardiogenic process with the inability to remove sufficient blood away from the pulmonary circulation or non-cardiogenic precipitated by injury to the lung parenchyma. It is an important pathologic feature in many disease processes, and hence learning the underlying disease process is crucial to guide its management. Clinical features include progressive worsening dyspnea, rales on lung auscultation, and worsening hypoxia.\n  Pulmonary edema is defined as an abnormal accumulation of extravascular fluid in the lung parenchyma. Two main types are cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.\n  Cardiogenic or volume-overload pulmonary edema arises due to a rapid elevation in the hydrostatic pressure of the pulmonary capillaries. This is typically seen in disorders involving left ventricular systolic and diastolic function (acute myocarditis including other etiologies of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction), valvular function (aortic/mitral regurgitation and stenosis in the moderate to the severe range), rhythm (atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, ventricular tachycardia, high degree, and third-degree heart block).\n  More than 1 million patients are admitted each year with a diagnosis of pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac causes (heart failure). An estimated 190,000 patients are diagnosed with acute lung injury each year. About 1.5 to 3.5 cases/100,000 population are diagnosed with ARDS.\n  Pulmonary edema can be broadly classified into cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.\n  - Review the pathophysiology of different types of pulmonary edema.\n  - Describe the management of different types of pulmonary edema.\n  - Summarize the importance of an interprofessional approach for effective management of patients with pulmonary edema.\n"

        "source_text": "[1] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17353-pericarditis\n  Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the thin, two-layered, fluid-filled sac that covers the outer surface of your heart. Pericarditis usually develops suddenly and may last from weeks up to several months. The condition usually clears up after three months, but sometimes attacks can come and go for years. Sometimes there is extra fluid in the space between the pericardial layers, which is called pericardial effusion.\n  - Acute pericarditis: Inflammation of the pericardium that develops suddenly along with the sudden onset of symptoms.\n  - Chronic pericarditis: Inflammation of the pericardium that lasts for three months or longer after the initial acute attack.\n  - Traumatic pericarditis: develops as the result of an injury to the chest, such as after a car accident.\n  - Infectious pericarditis: develops as the result of a viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infection.\n  - Constrictive pericarditis: A severe form of pericarditis in which the inflamed layers of the pericardium stiffen, develop scar tissue, thicken and stick together. Constrictive pericarditis interferes with your heart’s normal function. This usually happens after multiple episodes of acute pericarditis over time.\n  - Malignant pericarditis: develops as result of a cancer growing in your body.\n  - Idiopathic pericarditis: Pericarditis that doesn’t have a known cause.\n  When you have pericarditis, the membrane around your heart is red and swollen, like the skin around a cut that becomes inflamed. The pericardium is a thin, two-layered, fluid-filled sac that covers the outer surface of your heart. It provides lubrication for your heart, shields it from infection and malignancy, and contains your heart in your chest wall. It also keeps your heart from overexpanding when blood volume increases, which keeps your heart functioning efficiently.\n  Pericarditis can affect anyone, but it’s most common in men and people assigned male at birth who are between the ages of 16 and 65. An estimated 28 people per 100,000 get pericarditis each year.\n  Both of these are types of inflammation in your heart, but they’re in different places. Myocarditis is in your heart muscle. Pericarditis happens in your pericardium (the lining around your heart). Most often, a virus causes myocarditis and pericarditis. Both can give you chest pain, but with pericarditis, your chest pain should feel better when you sit up and lean forward. With myocarditis, you’ll usually feel tired and weak.\n  - Uremic pericarditis: develops as the result of kidney failure.\n[2] https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/pericarditis/what-is-pericarditis\n  Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, a sac-like structure with two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart to hold it in place and help it work. A small amount of fluid keeps the layers separate so there’s less friction between them as the heart beats.\n  Pericarditis can be attributed to several factors, including viral, bacterial, fungal and other infections. Other possible causes of pericarditis include heart attack or heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries and medications.\n  Pericarditis is frequently mild and may clear up on its own with rest or simple treatment. Sometimes, more intense treatment is needed to prevent complications.\n  The cause of pericarditis is often unknown, though viral infections are a common reason. Pericarditis may occur after a respiratory or digestive system infection.\n  Chronic and recurring pericarditis may be caused by autoimmune disorders such as lupus, scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis. These are disorders in which the body’s immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack the body’s tissues or cells.\n  Pericarditis can be acute, meaning it happens suddenly and typically doesn’t last long. Or the condition may be \"chronic,\" meaning that it develops over time and may take longer to treat.\n  - Chronic effusive pericarditis and chronic constrictive pericarditis (forms of chronic pericarditis)\n  Both types of pericarditis can disrupt your heart’s normal function. In rare cases, pericarditis can have very serious consequences, possibly leading to abnormal heart rhythm and death.\n  - Acute fibrinous pericarditis and acute purulent pericarditis (forms of acute pericarditis)\n  Recovery time from pericarditis may vary depending on the type of condition and the patient’s health. Consultation with a health care professional can determine this.\n[3] https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pericarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352510\n  Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding the heart (pericardium). Pericarditis often causes sharp chest pain. The chest pain occurs when the irritated layers of the pericardium rub against each other.\n  Other signs and symptoms of pericarditis may include:\n  Pericarditis is usually mild and goes away without treatment. Treatment for more-severe cases may include medications and, rarely, surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment may help reduce the risk of long-term complications from pericarditis.\n  Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It usually feels sharp or stabbing. However, some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain.\n  The specific symptoms depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last.\n  The heart on the left shows the typical outer lining of the heart (pericardium). The heart on the right shows a swollen and infected lining (pericarditis).\n  Pericarditis pain usually occurs behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest.
